Synopsis:
   $chvoices(<channel>)

Technical:
   * If the <channel> argument is omitted, the current window's current
     channel is used.  THIS IS NOT NECCESARILY THE CORRECT CHANNEL IN 
     AN /ON!
   * If the <channel> argument is the literal star character (``*''), the
     current window's current channel is used.  THIS IS NOT NECCESARILY THE
     CORRECT CHANNEL IN AN /ON!
   * This function returns the voiced users on the specified channel.
   * You must be on the channel; the empty string is returned if you are not.
   * Before /ON CHANNEL_SYNC is thrown, this function may return the empty
     string (because EPIC does not know who are the voiced users yet.)
   * A design defect in the historical server implementation may cause 
     truncated nicknames to be included in the list.  The client corrects 
     these truncated nicknames by watching the WHO reply.  Before 
     /ON CHANNEL_SYNC is thrown, truncated nicknames may be included in 
     this list.
   * Due to a limitation in the way the client must keep track of voiced
     users the list of nicks returned by this function may not always
     correctly represent the actual voiced users in a channel.

Returns:
   The voiced users on the specified channel.  You must be on the 
   channel.  Before /ON CHANNEL_SYNC, this function may return the empty
   string, or a list with truncated nicknames.

Examples:
   $chvoices(#foo)             shows voiced users on channel #foo
   $chvoices(*)                shows voiced users on current channel
   $chvoices()                 shows voiced users on current channel
