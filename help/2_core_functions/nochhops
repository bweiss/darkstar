Synopsis:
   $nochhops(<channel>)

Technical:
   * If the <channel> argument is omitted, the current window's current
     channel is used.  THIS IS NOT NECCESARILY THE CORRECT CHANNEL IN 
     AN /ON!
   * If the <channel> argument is the literal star character (``*''), the
     current window's current channel is used.  THIS IS NOT NECCESARILY THE
     CORRECT CHANNEL IN AN /ON!
   * This function returns the non-half-ops on the specified channel.
   * You must be on the channel; the empty string is returned if you are not.
   * Before /ON CHANNEL_SYNC is thrown, this function may return the empty
     string (because EPIC does not know who are the voiced users yet.)
   * A design defect in the historical server implementation may cause 
     truncated nicknames to be included in the list.  The client corrects 
     these truncated nicknames by watching the WHO reply.  Before 
     /ON CHANNEL_SYNC is thrown, truncated nicknames may be included in 
     this list.

Returns:
   The non-half-ops on the specified channel.  You must be on the channel.
   Before /ON CHANNEL_SYNC, this function may return the empty string,
   or a list with truncated nicknames.

Examples:
   $nochhops(#foo)             shows non-half-ops on channel #foo
   $nochhops(*)                shows non-half-ops on current channel
   $nochhops()                 shows non-half-ops on current channel
