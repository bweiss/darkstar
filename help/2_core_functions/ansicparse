Synopsis:
   $ansicparse(<text>)
   $ansicparse(<text> <arguments>...)

Description:
   This works exactly like the builtin $cparse() function, but outputs
   ANSI color codes instead of ^C color codes.

Returns:
   <text> after being passed through $cparse() and then having its color
   codes converted to their ANSI equivalents.

Credits:
   This function was written by Ben Winslow <rain@bluecherry.net>.

Other Notes:
   It should be mentioned that this function is pure evil and should NOT
   be used under any circumstances. ;-)
