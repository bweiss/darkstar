Description:
   The core scripts are the heart of the DarkStar/EPIC4 script pack. They
   handle the loading and unloading of modules, configuration of settings,
   saving, and the changing of statbars/themes. They also provide commands
   and functions for use in the various modules.

   This section documents the extra functions provided by the core scripts.
   It will be useful mostly to module authors.
