Synopsis:
   $ts()
   $ts(<time>)

Description:
   This is a timestamp function that can be used in themes to allow them
   provide timestamping support that is easily toggled via /DSET.

Technical:
   * If no <time> is specified then the current value of $time() will be used.
   * If present, the <time> argument must be in UTC format.
   * This function only returns a value if the TIMESTAMP config variable
     is ON.
   * The resulting format of the timestamp depends entirely on the value of
     the TIMESTAMP_FORMAT config variable. Its value, along with the UTC
     version of the time will be passed to strftime(). Consult your system's
     strftime() man page for details on formatting codes.

Returns:
   The current time (or <time>) formatted according to the TIMESTAMP_FORMAT
   config variable.

Other Notes:
   Due to the fact that TIMESTAMP_FORMAT is a config variable, it will not
   be passed through $cparse() and thus will not accept cparse color codes.
   The reason for this is that both $strftime() and $cparse() use the '%'
   character to prefix their expandos. If you would like to add color to
   your timestamps just use ^C color codes directly. See epic4/doc/color.txt
   and epic4/doc/colors for more information on ^C color codes.
