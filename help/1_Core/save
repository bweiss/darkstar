   This command writes all your config settings (/DSET and /FSET) for the
   specified module(s) to your save directory (or <directory> if '-d' is
   specified).

   All /DSET variables will be saved to files according to which module they
   belong to.

   All /FSET variables are written to a single file called custom.dst which
   can immediately be set as the current theme.
