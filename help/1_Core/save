Synopsis:
   save [-d <directory>] [<*> | <module> <module> ...]

Description:
   This command writes all your config settings (/DSET and /FSET) for the
   specified module(s) to your save directory (or <directory> if '-d' is
   specified).

   If "*" is given as a module name, the settings for all currently loaded
   modules, as well as the core scripts, will be saved.

   If "core" is given as a module name, the settings for the core scripts
   will be saved.

   Config variable settings are saved to files according to their module
   name in the specified save directory. Format variables are also saved to
   files according to their modules, but are placed in
   $DS.USER_DIR/themes/custom/
