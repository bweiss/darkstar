How to use the DarkStar/EPIC4 help system

DarkStar uses EPIC4's builtin /HELP command to browse its documentation and
thus tries to immitate it as closely as possible. If you are unfamiliar with
the use of /HELP please see help(1) in the EPIC Help Files. If you do not
have these, they can be obtained from the following sites:

ftp://ftp.epicsol.org/pub/epic/EPIC4-PRODUCTION/
http://www.got.net/~brian/epic4/

The help files for DarkStar are organized into the following groups:

   Section 1: Core Commands
   Section 2: Core Functions
   Section 3: Modules

In order to read a help file its section number must be given. This is true
except when you are already at the help prompt and in the proper section.

You can go back a section while at the help prompt by simply pressing the
ENTER key.

Throughout this documentation topics in the "See Also" sections will include
a UNIX manpage style section reference.

Topics viewed via /HELP will appear like normal:        whois(2)
Topics viewed via /DHELP will appear as:                ds:dset(1)

Examples:

   > /dhelp 1 dset
   1_Core Help? dset
