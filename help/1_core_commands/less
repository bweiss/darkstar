   less <file> ...
   more <file> ...

Description:
   An advanced file pager. Displays the contents of each <file> to the
   current window. This will take into account things like linewrapping
   and non-display characters so that the displayed text truly fits on
   the screen. It also allows module authors to use it to break up any
   output into screen-size chunks for later display (using Karll arrays).
   See doc/less.txt for more information.
