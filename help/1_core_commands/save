Synopsis:
   save [-d <directory>] [-c|-f] [*|<module> ...]

Description:
   This command saves all your config (/DSET), format (/FSET), and
   status (/SET STATUS*) settings for the specified module(s) to your
   save directory (or <directory> if '-d' is present).

    - If the '-d' option is given as the first argument then the next
      argument will be used as the save directory.
    - If the '-c' or '-f' options are given then only the config or format
      settings will be saved, depending on the option specified.
    - If "*" is given as a module name, the settings for all currently
      loaded modules, as well as the core scripts, will be saved.
    - If "core" is given as a module name, the settings for the core
      scripts will be saved.

Other Notes:
   As of DarkStar 0.3 modules can create special aliases that will be run
   automatically whenever the settings for that module are saved. See
   doc/modules.txt for more information.
