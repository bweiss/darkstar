Synopsis:
   save [-d <directory>] [*|<module> ...]

Description:
   This command saves all your config (/DSET), format (/FSET), and
   status (/SET STATUS*) settings.
   specified module(s) to your save directory (or <directory> if '-d' is
   specified).

    - If the '-d' option is given as the first argument an alternate
      save directory for config settings may be specified. This does NOT
      affect format and status settings.
    - If "*" is given as a module name, the settings for all currently
      loaded modules, as well as the core scripts, will be saved.
    - If "core" is given as a module name, the settings for the core
      scripts will be saved.

   Config variable settings are saved to files according to their module
   name in the specified save directory. Format variables are also saved to
   files according to their modules, but are instead placed in
   $DS.USER_DIR/themes/custom/. The current status bar settings are written
   to $DS.USER_DIR/status/custom.
