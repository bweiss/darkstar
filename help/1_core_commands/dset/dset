Synopsis:
   dset [<variable> [<value>]]
   dset [-<variable>]

Description:
   This command is used to set/view the values of DarkStar's user
   configurable variables. It mimics as closely as possible the behavior
   of EPIC's internal /SET command.

   If no value for the given variable is specified, the current value is
   displayed.  The client will display all matching variables if the given
   is ambiguous.  If no variable name is given, all variables and their
   values are displayed.  If the variable name is preceded by a hyphen
   (-), the variable is unset, giving it no value.
