   dhelp [<topic> [<subtopic> ...]]

Description:
   This is the Darkstar help command. It is used to browse the user
   documentation for the Darkstar/EPIC4 script pack (which you are currently
   reading). Advanced topics and programming HOWTOs will not be viewed in
   this way.

   This command uses EPIC4's internal /HELP command, and as such, has the
   same features and usage.
