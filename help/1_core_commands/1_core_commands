Description:
   The core scripts are the heart of the Darkstar/EPIC4 script pack. They
   handle the loading and unloading of modules, configuration of settings,
   saving, and the changing of statbars/themes. They also provide commands
   and functions for use in the various modules.

   This section documents the end-user commands provided by the core scripts.
