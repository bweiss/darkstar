   Formatted /names output that is a bit more powerful than what is
   supplied by the client.

Config Variables:
   NAMES_COL           - Integer. Determines how many columns to display.
                         An empty or "0" value uses infinite columns.

                         before everyone else.

Format Variables:

   NAMES_OP, NAMES_RIGHT, NAMES_VOICE
