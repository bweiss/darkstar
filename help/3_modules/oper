Description:
   IRC Operator stuff including an operview window and support for
   challenge-response opering (ratbox and some hyb7 servers).

Config Variables:
   AUTO_CHALLENGE         - Boolean. If true, you will automatically be opered
                            via challenge-response on any servers that have
                            have entries in the challenge-response list.
   CHALLENGE_RSA_RESPOND  - Path to the rsa_respond binary. This is required
                            to use challenge-response.
   OPER_UMODES            - User modes to set when you become an operator.
   OPERVIEW               - Boolean. Creates a new window called "operview"
                            that will display operator related messages
                            such as wallops and server notices. This feature
                            is not recommended for use with multiple server
                            connections in a single client process.
   OPERVIEW_HIDDEN        - Boolean. Determines whether the operview window
                            will be split or hidden.
   OPERVIEW_SIZE          - Size of the operview window when it is not hidden.

Commands:
   challenge -add <server> <nick> <key>
   challenge -del <server>
   challenge -list
   challenge [nick]
     - Manages the challenge-response list or issues a CHALLENGE command
       to the current server for [nick]. In order for this to work the
       CHALLENGE_RSA_RESPOND config variable must be set to the location
       of the rsa_respond binary and there must be an entry for the server
       in the challenge-response list.

   operview [on|off]
     - Toggles the operview window.

   operwall <text>
     - Sends an OPERWALL with <text>.
