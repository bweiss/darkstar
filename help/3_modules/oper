Description:
   Operator stuff. Doesn't do much at the moment but still has dreams
   of greatness.

Config Variables:
   AUTO_CHALLENGE         - Boolean. If true, you will automatically be opered
                            with the /CHALLENGE command on any servers that
                            have entries in the challenge list.
   CHALLENGE_RSA_RESPOND  - Path to the rsa_respond binary. This is required
                            to use the any of the challenge related features.
   OPER_UMODES            - User modes to set when you become an operator.
   OPERVIEW               - Boolean. Creates a new window called "operview"
                            that will display operator related messages
                            such as wallops and server notices.
   OPERVIEW_HIDDEN        - Boolean. Determines whether the operview window
                            will be split or hidden.
   OPERVIEW_SIZE          - Size of the operview window when it is not hidden.

Commands:
   challenge -add <server> <nick> <key>
   challenge -del <server>
   challenge -list
   challenge [nick]
     - Manages the challenge list or issues a CHALLENGE command to the
       current server for [nick]. For this to work, the CHALLENGE_RSA_RESPOND
       config variable must be set to the location of the rsa_respond binary
       and there must be an entry for the server in the challenge list.

   operview [on|off]
     - Toggles the operview window.

   operwall <text>
     - Sends an OPERWALL with <text>.
