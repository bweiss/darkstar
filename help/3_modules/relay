Module: relay
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   Relays your last sent/received msgs and notices.

Config Variables:
   RELAY_BUFFER_SIZE       - This determines the number of items that
                             will be stored for each type.

Commands:
   clearrelaybuf
     - Clears all the arrays containing your msgs and notices.

   relay -<m|n|sm|sn> <target> [<item number>|ask]
     - Relays a specific type of msg to <target>. Takes an optional
       item number argument that defaults to "ask" (which prompts the
       user to choose an item from a list). The types are as follows:
       m - msg    n - notice    sm - sent_msg    sn - sent_notice

   relm [<target>] [<item number>|ask]
     - Relays received messages. Takes optional <target> and <item num>
       arguments. If no item number is specified, it will default to
       the last message in the buffer (unlike /relay).

   reln [<target>] [<item number>|ask]
     - Relays received notices.

   relsm [<target>] [<item number>|ask]
     - Relays sent messages.

   relsn [<target>] [<item number>|ask]
     - Relays sent notices.
