Module: relay
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   Relays previously sent or received messages to a new target.

Config Variables:
   RELAY_BUFFER_SIZE       - This determines the number of items that
                             will be stored for each type.
   RELAY_STRIP_CRAP        - Boolean. If true, all escape sequences will
                             be stripped from output before being sent
                             to the target.

Commands:
   relay <type> [-clear|-list|<item#> [<target>]]
     - The <type> argument determines the type of message. The possible
       values are as follows (abbreviations in parenthesis):
         (c)ctcp, (cr)ctcp_reply, (m)msg, (n)notice, (p)public,
         (po)public_other, (sc)send_ctcp, (sm)send_msg, (sn)send_notice,
         (sp)send_public, (spo)send_public_other
     - The "-clear" option will clear the relay buffer for <type>
     - The "-list" option displays the current relay buffer for <type>
     - If no item # is given, the most recent entry will be used.
     - If no target is given, the current window's target ($T) will be used.
