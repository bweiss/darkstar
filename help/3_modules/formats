Description:
   Formatting stuff including /NAMES output and message highlighting
   (previously known as auto-response).

Config Variables:
   HIGHLIGHT                 - Boolean. Turns highlight on/off.
   HIGHLIGHT_BEEP            - Boolean. If true, the client will beep once
                               when something is highlighted.
   HIGHLIGHT_IGNORE_CHANNELS - Space separated list of channels that should
                               be ignored for highlighting.
   HIGHLIGHT_IGNORE_NICKS    - Space separated list of nicks that should
                               never be highlighted.
   HIGHLIGHT_LIST            - Space separated list of words that should
                               trigger highlight.
   HIGHLIGHT_NOTIFY          - Boolean. If true, a notification will
                               be echoed to the current window whenever
                               auto-response is triggered in another
                               window.
   NAMES_COL                 - Integer. Number of columns to display.
                               An empty or "0" value allows infinite columns.
   NAMES_SORT_BY_MODE        - Boolean. If true, users will be sorted by mode
                               before being displayed.
   SHOW_AWAY_ONCE            - Boolean. If true it will prevent the WHOIS_AWAY
                               numeric from being displayed each time you
                               msg/notice someone. This will not stop you
                               from seeing it when you /WHOIS them.
   SHOW_AWAY_ONCE_TIMEOUT    - Seconds until items are removed from the
                               away_users arrays.
   SHOW_HOST_ONCE            - Boolean. If true the hostnames of users that
                               are sending you private msgs or notices will
                               only be displayed once every 30 mins.
                               (Just the default. See below.)
   SHOW_HOST_ONCE_TIMEOUT    - Seconds until items are removed from the
                               userhosts arrays.
