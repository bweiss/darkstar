Module: tabkey
Author: CrazyEddy / Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   Advanced tab key completion that is very extensible and attempts to
   complete just about everything, including: commands, channels, nicks,
   files, modules, and config, format, and set variables. It also keeps
   track of private msgs and DCC CHAT connections for easy replies.

Config Variables:
   TABKEY_CYCLE_MATCHES     - Boolean. If true, continually pushing the
                              tab key will cause the module to cycle through
                              the list of possible matches.
   TABKEY_MAX_MSG_HISTORY   - Max number of nicks to store in the msg
                              history for /MSG completion.
   TABKEY_NICKCOMP_SUFFIX   - If completing a nickname, and the nick is the
                              first word on the input prompt, append this
                              to it.

History:
   This module is based on the tabkey.ce script written by CrazyEddy and
   distributed with EPIC4. His ingenious design and code are responsible
   for making this script possible. Many thanks.
