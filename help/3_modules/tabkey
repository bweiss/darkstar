Module: tabkey
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   Advanced tab key completion that tries to be very extensible and
   configurable. Includes completion for commands, channels, nicks, files,
   modules, and config, format, and set variables. Also keeps track of
   things like private msgs and DCC chats for easy replies.

Config Variables:
   TABKEY_NICK_HISTORY      - Number of nicks to remember for msg completion.
   TABKEY_NICKCOMP_SUFFIX   - If completing a nickname, and the nick is the
                              first word on the input prompt, append this
                              to it.

Commands:
   tabkey addrule <pattern> <procedure> [extra arguments]
     - Adds a new completion rule that calls <procedure> when completing
       anything that matches <pattern>. The [extra arguments] are usually
       optional and are given as the arguments to the procedure being
       executed. It is important to be aware that the word list is evaluated
       before being processed by the procedure. It is also very important
       that both the <pattern> and [extra arguments] are quoted.

   tabkey clear
     - Clears the msg history. This replaces the old /cleartab alias.

   tabkey listrules
     - Display a list of all completion rules currently loaded.

   tabkey rmrule <pattern>
     - Removes a completion rule. As with addrule, the <pattern> argument
       must be quoted. If "all" is given as a pattern (it does not need to
       be quoted) then the entire list of completion rules will be cleared.

   tabkey saverules
     - Writes the current list of completion rules to the file tabkey.rules
       in your save directory. If this file exists, it will override the
       default rules.
