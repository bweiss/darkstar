Module: tabkey
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>
        Original code and design by CrazyEddy

Description:
   Advanced tab key completion that is very extensible and attempts to
   complete just about everything, including: commands, channels, nicks,
   files, modules, and config, format, and set variables. It also keeps
   track of private msgs and DCC CHAT connections for easy replies.

Config Variables:
   TABKEY_CYCLE_MATCHES     - This enables or disables match cycling
                              whenever the Tab key is pressed a second
                              time with no change on the input line.
                              There are three possible values:
                                 0 (or <EMPTY>) - No match cycling
                                 1 - Forward match cycling
                                 2 - Backward match cycling
   TABKEY_MAX_MSG_HISTORY   - Max number of nicks to store in the msg
                              history for /MSG completion.
   TABKEY_NICKCOMP_SUFFIX   - If completing a nickname, and the nick is the
                              first word on the input prompt, append this
                              to it.

Key Bindings:
   ^I (Tab)                   TABKEY_COMPLETION, TABKEY_COMPLETION_FORWARD,
                              or TABKEY_COMPLETION_BACKWARD (depends on
                              the value of TABKEY_CYCLE_MATCHES).

History:
   This module is based on the tabkey.ce script written by CrazyEddy and
   distributed with EPIC4. His ingenious design and code are responsible
   for making this script possible. Many thanks.
