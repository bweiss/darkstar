Module: tabkey
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   Advanced tab key completion that tries to be very extensible and
   configurable. Includes completion for commands, channels, nicks, files,
   modules, and config, format, and set variables. Also keeps track of
   things like private msgs and DCC chats for easy replies. While this is
   still very much a work in progress, and doesn't have an easy interface
   for configuration, it should work quite well for most people. If you
   wish to tweak with things, please see the comments in tabkey.dsm and/or
   contact me.

Config Variables:
   TABKEY_NICK_HISTORY      - Number of nicks to remember for msg completion.
   TABKEY_NICKCOMP_SUFFIX   - If completing a nickname, and the nick is the
                              first word on the input prompt, append this
                              to it.

Commands:
   cleartab
     - Clear the tabkey nick history.
