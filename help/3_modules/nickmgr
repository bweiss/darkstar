Module: nickmgr
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   This module is a complete nick management script. It allows you to
   maintain a list of nicknames, sorted by priority, that will be monitored
   for availability. It also has the ability to ignore netsplits and is
   even multi-server safe.

Config Variables:
   NICKMGR                        - Boolean. Enables/disables the
                                    nick manager.
   NICKMGR_AUTO_ADD_NICKS         - Boolean. If true, the /NICK command
                                    will add nicks to the nicklist.
   NICKMGR_IGNORE_NETSPLITS       - Boolean. If true, the nick manager
                                    will ignore signoffs that appear to
                                    be the result of a netsplit.
   NICKMGR_IGNORE_TIMEOUT         - Time in seconds that a nick should
                                    be ignored because of a netsplit.
                                    (Default: 900)
   NICKMGR_NICKLIST               - Your list of desired nicknames with
                                    the highest priority nicks first.
   NICKMGR_SCAN_INTERVAL          - Time in seconds between each nick
                                    scan. Remember, the nick scan has to
                                    check every nick in the nicklist for
                                    every active server connection.
                                    Because of this I have imposed a
                                    minimum interval of 10 seconds,
                                    though a much higher setting is
                                    recommended. (Default: 60)

Commands:
   nick <nickname>
     - Wrapper to the builtin nick(1) command. If NICK_MANAGER_AUTO_ADD_NICKS
       is true, it will automatically add nicks to the nicklist.

   nickmgr [-a|-d] [nick ...]
     - Adds or removes nicks from NICKMGR_NICKLIST. The -a and -d options
       specify which action to perform (add/delete). The default is to add.
       If no arguments are given then the current list is displayed.

   nickscan
     - Performs a scan for available nicks on all active server connections.
       This will also be run automatically every so often according to the
       value of NICKMGR_SCAN_INTERVAL.
