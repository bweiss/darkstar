Module: nickmgr
Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   This module is a complete nick management script. It allows you to
   maintain a list of nicknames, sorted by priority, that will be monitored
   for availability. It also has the ability to ignore netsplits and is
   even multi-server safe.

Config Variables:
   NICK_MANAGER                      - Boolean. Enables/disables the
                                       nick manager.
   NICK_MANAGER_AUTO_ADD_NICKS       - Boolean. If true, the /NICK command
                                       will add nicks to the nicklist.
   NICK_MANAGER_IGNORE_NETSPLITS     - Boolean. If true, the nick manager
                                       will ignore signoffs that appear to
                                       be the result of a netsplit.
   NICK_MANAGER_IGNORE_TIMEOUT       - Time in seconds that a nick should
                                       be ignored because of a netsplit.
                                       (Default: 900)
   NICK_MANAGER_NICKLIST             - Your list of desired nicknames with
                                       the highest priority nicks first.
   NICK_MANAGER_SCAN_INTERVAL        - Time in seconds between each nick
                                       scan. Remember, the nick scan has to
                                       check every nick in the nicklist for
                                       every active server connection.
                                       Because of this I have imposed a
                                       minimum interval of 10 seconds,
                                       though a much higher setting is
                                       recommended. (Default: 60)

Commands:
   nick <nickname>
     - Wrapper to the builtin nick(1) command. If NICK_MANAGER_AUTO_ADD_NICKS
       is true, it will automatically add nicks to the nicklist.

   nickscan
     - Performs a scan for available nicks on all active server connections.
       This will also be run automatically every so often according to the
       value of NICK_MANAGER_SCAN_INTERVAL.
