Description:
   Away system. Includes support for logging private msgs and notices,
   auto-away, auto-unset-away, and allows the user to choose which
   channels, if any, they would like to send a public away message to.

Config Variables:
   AUTO_AWAY                 - Boolean. If true, sets away after...
   AUTO_AWAY_TIME            - Auto-away after this many seconds.
   AUTO_UNSET_AWAY           - Boolean. If true, will automatically unset
                               away when anything is entered at the input
                               prompt.
   AWAY_LOG                  - Boolean. If true, private msgs and notices
                               will be logged when away.
   AWAY_LOGFILE              - Where to write the away log.
   PUBLIC_AWAY               - Boolean. Determines whether we should send
                               an action letting everyone know you are
                               away/back.
   PUBLIC_AWAY_CHANNELS      - Space separated list of channels to send
                               the public away to. If unset, all channels
                               you are currently in will be notified.
   SEND_AWAY_NOTICE          - Boolean. Determines whether we should send
                               a notice to people that msg you, letting
                               them know you are away.
