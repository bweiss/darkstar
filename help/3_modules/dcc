Description:
   DCC related features and formatting.

Config Variables:
   DCC_AUTOGET             - Boolean. If true, all DCC SEND requests to you
                             will be automatically accepted.

Format Variables:
   DCC_CHAT                - Messages received over a DCC CHAT connection.
   SEND_DCC_CHAT           - Messages sent over a DCC CHAT connection.

Commands:
   chat <nick>
     - Alias to /dcc chat.

Other Notes:
   It is wise, especially if you enable autoget, to change the value of
   /set DCC_STORE_PATH to something other than your home directory. This
   will prevent people from overwriting files there and also helps to
   maintain your sanity. I use ~/incoming, but you are free to make up
   anything you like.
