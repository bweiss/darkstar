Description:
   DCC related features and formatting.

Config Variables:
   DCC_AUTOGET             - Boolean. If true, all DCC SEND requests to you
                             will be automatically accepted.

Commands:
   chat <nick>
     - Alias to /dcc chat.

   dcc
     - Wrapper alias to the internal DCC command that will automatically close
       quoted filenames in a DCC SEND. See dcc(1) in the EPIC help files for
       details regarding the internal command.

Other Notes:
   It is wise, especially if you enable autoget, to change the value of
   /SET DCC_STORE_PATH to something other than your home directory. This
   will prevent people from overwriting files there and also helps to
   maintain your sanity. I use ~/incoming, but you are free to make up
   anything you like.
