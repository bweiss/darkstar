   Provides various commands, keybindings, and other features to assist
   in window management.

Config Variables:
   AUTO_BIND_CHANNELS         - If $CONFIG.AUTO_CREATE_WINDOWS is true,
                                bind the specified channels to windows as
                                they are created.
   AUTO_CREATE_WINDOWS        - Number of windows you want to have when
                                this module loads.
   AUTO_QUERY                 - Boolean. Automatically create a new window
                                with a query for each user that msgs you.
   AUTO_QUERY_UPDATE          - Boolean. Automatically update existing
                                queries when a nick change is detected.
   BIND_ON_JOIN               - Boolean. Automatically bind channels
                                when you join them.
   JOIN_NEW_WINDOW            - Boolean. If true, a new window will be
                                created automatically whenever you join a
                                new channel.
   JOIN_NEW_WINDOW_ARGS       - Extra arguments to be passed to /WINDOW
                                when the new window is created.
   MSG_WINDOW                 - Boolean. Creates a new window called "msgs"
                                in which all incoming private messages will
                                be displayed.
   MSG_WINDOW_HIDDEN          - Boolean. Determines whether the msg window
                                will be hidden or split.
   MSG_WINDOW_LEVEL           - Comma-separated list of window levels for
                                the msg window. This determines what actually
                                goes to the msg window.
   MSG_WINDOW_SIZE            - Size of the msg window. This only applies
                                when MSG_WINDOW_HIDDEN is false.
   PART_KILL_WINDOW           - Boolean. If true, leaving a channel will
                                cause its window to be killed.
   UNBIND_ON_PART             - Boolean. Automatically unbind channels

   wb [channel]
     - Attempts to bind [channel] (or the current channel) to the current

   wc
     - Create a new hidden window. This is status-aware and will set

   In addition to the above commands, this module will automatically
   add and remove shortcut aliases (of the form /1, /2, /3, etc.) for
   all existing windows.
