Author: Brian Weiss <brian@epicsol.org>

Description:
   Provides various commands, keybindings, and other features to assist
   in window management.

Config Variables:
   AUTO_BIND_CHANNELS         - If $CONFIG.AUTO_CREATE_WINDOWS is true,
                                bind the specified channels to windows as
                                they are created.
   AUTO_CREATE_WINDOWS        - Number of windows you want to have when
                                this module loads.
   AUTO_QUERY_ON_MSG          - Boolean. Automatically create a new window
                                and start a query for incoming private msgs.
   BIND_ON_JOIN               - Boolean. Automatically bind channels
                                when you join them.
   MSG_WINDOW                 - Boolean. Creates a split screen "msg window".
   MSG_WINDOW_LEVEL           - Comma-separated list of window levels for
                                the msg window. This determines what actually
                                goes to the msg window.
   MSG_WINDOW_SIZE            - Size of the msg window.
   UNBIND_ON_PART             - Boolean. Automatically unbind channels
                                after you part them.

Commands:
   swap [window name or refnum]
     - Attempts to swap to another window. If no refnum or name is given
       you will be prompted for one.

   wb [channel]
     - Attempts to bind [channel] (or the current channel) to the current
       window.

   wc
     - Create a new hidden window. This is status-aware and will set
       window double accordingly.

   wj <channel> [key]
     - Creates a new hidden window and joins <channel>. This is also
       status-aware.

   wk
     - Kill the current window.

   wl
     - Alias to '/window last'

   wn
     - Alias to '/window next'

     - Alias to '/window previous'

   wq
     - Creates a hidden window and starts a query for <nick> in it.

   wub
     - Unbinds the current window.

Other Notes:
   In addition to the above commands, this module will automatically
   add and remove shortcut aliases (of the form /1, /2, /3, etc.) for
   all existing windows.
