Description:
   Advanced nick completion for the input prompt.

Config Variables:
   NICK_COMPLETION         - Boolean. Turns nick completion on/off.
   NICK_COMPLETION_CHAR    - When the first word (that isn't a command) being
                             entered at the input prompt is this character,
                             a completion based on the nicks in the current
                             channel will be attempted.

Format Variables:
   NICK_COMPLETION         - Formatting for nick completion. This does NOT
                             get passed through $cparse(), so cparse color
                             codes will not work.

History:
   This was taken from my BitchX/EPIC4 script called playdough.
