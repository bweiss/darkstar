Description:
   Advanced nick completion for the input prompt.

Config Variables:
   NICK_COMPLETION           - Boolean. Turns nick completion on/off.
   NICK_COMPLETION_CHAR      - When the first word (that isn't a command)
                               being entered at the input prompt is this
                               character, a completion based on the nicks
                               in the current channel will be attempted.
   NICK_COMPLETION_PATTERNS  - Space separated list of patterns to use when
                               looking for matching nicks. This allows for
                               greater control over what constitutes a match.
   NICK_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD - This is the maximum number of matches that
                               will trigger nick completion. You can adjust
                               this to change the accuracy of the completion.
                               If set to a low number like "1" completion
                               will only be activated if there is just a
                               single match.

Format Variables:
   NICK_COMPLETION           - Formatting for nick completion. This does
                               NOT get passed through $cparse(), so cparse
                               color codes will not work.

History:
   This was taken from my BitchX/EPIC4 script called playdough.
