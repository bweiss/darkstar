*** News 2009/02/14 -- Removed memo module
	The memo module has been removed because uh... well, it's
	just stupid and probably never used by anyone. So yeah.

*** News 2009/02/07 -- BlackJac's history script added to core
	The history script written by BlackJac and distributed with
	the EPIC5 source code is now included in the DarkStar core
	scripts and will always be loaded.

*** News 2009/02/07 -- HELP/DHELP removed (for now)
	For the time being, neither the /HELP nor /DHELP commands will
	be available. The EPIC help files are now best viewed on the
	the EPIC Help Wiki (http://help.epicsol.org/) and I will probably
	write a new /DHELP command that will be intended for new users
	at some future date.

*** News 2007/09/21 -- xform functions for latest EPIC5
	The latest release of EPIC5 (0.3.5) has removed the following
	functions as they are now included in the builtins script:
	encode, decode, urlencode, urldecode, b64encode, b64decode,
	sedcrypt, sha256. These functions are now included in the
	DarkStar core scripts.

*** News 2007/07/03 -- $igmask(), $igtype(), $rigmask(), $rigtype()
	Added the above functions to the core scripts. These were all
	builtin functions that were removed in EPIC5 so I have added
	the scripted versions from BlackJac's builtins script.
