*** News 2007/09/21 -- xform functions for latest EPIC5
	The latest release of EPIC5 (0.3.5) has removed the following
	functions as they are now included in the builtins script:
	encode, decode, urlencode, urldecode, b64encode, b64decode,
	sedcrypt, sha256. These functions are now included in the
	DarkStar core scripts.

*** News 2007/07/03 -- $igmask(), $igtype(), $rigmask(), $rigtype()
	Added the above functions to the core scripts. These were all
	builtin functions that were removed in EPIC5 so I have added
	the scripted versions from BlackJac's builtins script.
