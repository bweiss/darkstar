*** News 2002/06/11 -- channel.dsm 0.5.5
	Added an alias called /etopic that will allow you to edit the
	current topic by placing it on the input line preceded by "/topic".
	The /tt and /ttopic aliases point to /etopic.

*** News 2002/06/09 -- tabkey.dsm 0.7.2
	The assign procedure has been renamed aliasctl and now handles
	completion for both assign variables and aliases. This will cause
	old rules that use the assign procedure to be rejected, so check
	your custom rules if you have any. Several new completion rules
	were also added to the defaults.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- New config variable: AUTO_SAVE_ON_UNLOAD
	The name says it all. It has a boolean value that, when true,
	will cause a module's settings to be saved before it is unloaded.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- VERBOSE_SAVE and VERBOSE_LOAD renamed
	The VERBOSE_SAVE and VERBOSE_LOAD config variables that are part
	of the core scripts have been renamed to SAVE_VERBOSE and
	LOADMODULE_VERBOSE.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- tabkey.dsm 0.7
	Changes include a /tabkey alias which provides an interface to
	modifying completion rules and replaces the /cleartab alias.
	While adding this, I also solved the annoying issues regarding
	rule #1 and the "" pattern.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- The ChangeLog is no more
	I have decided to do away with the ChangeLog, mostly because
	CVS already does a better job of tracking changes for me, and
	end users don't need to know the gory details. Instead, I will
	use this file called UPDATES to let people know about important
	changes without all the technical details. Yes, this is just
	like the file of the same name included with EPIC4 :-).
