*** News 2011/09/15 -- Added /WSB and /WSF aliases
	Shortcuts to /WINDOW SEARCH_{BACK|FORWARD} commands.

*** News 2010/01/26 -- Added /DSET AWAY_LOG_ALWAYS to away module
	If true, logging will occur regardless of whether you are set as
	away on the server. This may be temporary until I can add more
	generic logging support.
	
*** News 2010/01/26 -- Added /RE alias to misc module
	Sends a response to the last person that send you a private message.

*** News 2010/01/22 -- Added /FREE and /HOLD to window module
	These are shortcuts to /WINDOW HOLD_MODE [ON|OFF]

*** News 2010/01/22 -- Added /DSET TABKEY_MSGHIST_SENT_ONLY to tabkey module
	If true, this will only add nicks to the msg history for outbound
	private msgs and DCC requests.

*** News 2010/01/22 -- Added BlackJac's newnick script from EPIC5
	This simulates the automatic nickname-mangling feature of EPIC4.
	This includes several new /SET vars:
		set auto_new_nick [on|off|toggle]
		set auto_new_nick_char [<character>]
		set auto_new_nick_length [<positive integer>]
		set auto_new_nick_list [<string>]

*** News 2009/02/14 -- Removed memo module
	The memo module has been removed because uh... well, it's
	just stupid and probably never used by anyone. So yeah.

*** News 2009/02/07 -- BlackJac's history script added to core
	The history script written by BlackJac and distributed with
	the EPIC5 source code is now included in the DarkStar core
	scripts and will always be loaded.

*** News 2009/02/07 -- HELP/DHELP removed (for now)
	For the time being, neither the /HELP nor /DHELP commands will
	be available. The EPIC help files are now best viewed on the
	the EPIC Help Wiki (http://help.epicsol.org/) and I will probably
	write a new /DHELP command that will be intended for new users
	at some future date.

*** News 2007/09/21 -- xform functions for latest EPIC5
	The latest release of EPIC5 (0.3.5) has removed the following
	functions as they are now included in the builtins script:
	encode, decode, urlencode, urldecode, b64encode, b64decode,
	sedcrypt, sha256. These functions are now included in the
	DarkStar core scripts.

*** News 2007/07/03 -- $igmask(), $igtype(), $rigmask(), $rigtype()
	Added the above functions to the core scripts. These were all
	builtin functions that were removed in EPIC5 so I have added
	the scripted versions from BlackJac's builtins script.
