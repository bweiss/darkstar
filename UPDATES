*** News 2007/03/24 -- Officially moving to EPIC5
	I'm finally making the move to EPIC5 as the base for DarkStar.
	There is still much to be done but this just makes it official.

*** News 2005/04/20 -- formats.dsm 0.5 - KNOCK formats
	Formats for the KNOCK feature present on EFNet servers has
	finally been added. The format variables are: KNOCK,
	KNOCK_CHANNEL_OPEN, KNOCK_DELIVERED, and KNOCK_LIMIT_EXCEEDED.

*** News 2005/04/08 -- New global variable: LEVELS
	There is a new global variable named LEVELS that will always
	contain a list of the valid window levels. This will hold
	a different value depending on whether EPIC4 or EPIC5 is
	being used. Note: EPIC5 is NOT officially supported yet.
	Currently only minor changes are being made to support it
	since I know people will use it even if I tell them not to.

*** News 2005/04/07 -- tabkey.dsm 1.0 - Esc-Tab key binding
	A key binding for Esc-Tab (^[^I) has been added to the
	tabkey module that, when pressed, will attempt completion
	of the current input line with backward match cycling enabled.
	Due to this change, the Esc-Tab key binding has been removed
	from the window module and the TABKEY_CYCLE_MATCHES config
	variable has been removed.

*** News 2005/03/29 -- No more /SET REVERSE_STATUS_LINE in themes
	The REVERSE_STATUS_LINE set has been removed from all themes
	and is no longer written to themes saved with /THEME -SAVE.
	The proper way to toggle inverse on a status bar is to prefix
	the STATUS_FORMAT* sets with ^O and optionally ^V (to enable
	inverse text). This is in preparation for the eventual move
	to EPIC5.

*** News 2005/03/27 -- tabkey.dsm 0.6 - Forward/backward match cycling
	The tabkey module now has the ability to perform backward
	match cycling. In light of this change the TABKEY_CYCLE_MATCHES
	config variable has changed slightly. It is no longer a boolean
	variable but can hold one of 3 values: 0 (or <EMPTY>) which
	disables match cycling, 1 which turns on forward match cycling,
	or 2 which enables backward cycling.

*** News 2004/08/24 -- formats.dsm 0.4 - Highlighting in actions
	The HIGHLIGHT feature now supports highlighting in actions, both
	public and private. As a result, there are 3 new format variables:
	ACTION_CHANNEL_HL, ACTION_CHANNEL_OTHER_HL, and ACTION_USER_HL.
	Theme authors will want to add these to their themes so that they
	are formatted properly.


DarkStar 0.3 (20040814)


*** News 2004/08/13 -- New function: $chnormal()
	This new function works just like $chops()/$chvoices()/etc. but
	returns only the users that are NOT +o, +h, or +v. The $nochops()
	function differs from this in that it returns all non-ops including
	half-ops and voiced users.

*** News 2004/08/10 -- nickcomp.dsm 1.2 - /DSET NICK_COMPLETION_PATTERNS
	There is a new config variable, named NICK_COMPLETION_PATTERNS, that
	will allow users to better configure the behavior of nick completion
	in the nickcomp module.

*** News 2004/07/29 -- formats.dsm 0.3 - Auto-response renamed: Highlight
	The auto-response feature that highlights publics when they contain
	certain words has been renamed to "highlight". This means that all
	related config and format variables have also been renamed. In most
	cases this just means that "AUTO_RESPONSE" becomes "HIGHLIGHT" with
	the exception of the AUTO_RESPONSE_STR config variable being renamed
	to HIGHLIGHT_LIST. All highlight related format variables are now
	suffixed with "_HL" instead of "_AR". There are also two new config
	variables for exempting specific channels and nicks from triggering
	a highlight. They are called HIGHLIGHT_IGNORE_CHANNELS and
	HIGHLIGHT_IGNORE_NICKS.

*** News 2004/06/01 -- Timestamp support! $ts()
	I have finally added a $ts() function for use in themes to
	provide timestamping that can be toggled via /DSET. The related
	config variables are named TIMESTAMP and TIMESTAMP_FORMAT.
	See ds:ts(2) for more details.

*** News 2004/06/01 -- $loadedmods()/$mods() now take arguments
	The $loadedmods() and $mods() functions provided by the core
	core scripts are now able to take pattern arguments just like
	the builtin $getsets() function.

*** News 2004/05/31 -- New functions: (no)chhops/(no)chvoices
	We have several new functions that allow you to get a list
	of the current voiced or half-op users. They are called
	$chhops(), $nochhops(), $chvoices(), and $nochvoices().
	They work just like the builtin $chops()/$nochops() functions.

	The $chvoices() function is the old $chanvoice() function
	donated by Ben Winslow. It has been renamed for consistency.

*** News 2004/04/26 -- formats.dsm 0.2 - New format: SERVER_NOTICE
	There is a new format variable called SERVER_NOTICE that will
	be used to format all, yep you guessed it, server notices.

*** News 2004/04/17 -- window.dsm 0.10.2 - /DSET MSG_WINDOW_LEVEL
	A new config variable named MSG_WINDOW_LEVEL has been added.
	This already existed with the old msg window code but I never
	bothered writing it into the new multi-server msgwin code.

*** News 2003/12/11 -- Module header formats have changed
	The format of module headers has changed. Module header tags
	are now specified in the form "# <tag>:<value> ...". This allows
	for any number of tags to be supported although currently there
	are only two: version and loader. There are two possible values
	for the loader tag: std and pf. The default is "std" so module
	authors can continue using the standard loader and won't have to
	reformat their scripts.

*** News 2003/12/11 -- ALL SCRIPTS NOW USE PRE-FORMATTED LOADER
	As of this date all scripts, both core and modules, have been
	rewritten so that they can be loaded with EPIC's pre-formatted
	loader (epic4/doc/pf-loader) instead of the standard loader
	normally used by /LOAD. As a result, all scripts should now load
	about 30% faster.

*** News 2003/12/11 -- window.dsm - Multi-server msg windows!
	The window module now supports multi-server msg windows. Now, when
	you connect to multiple servers and use the msg window feature,
	it will automatically create a msg window for each server connection
	and swap between them whenever you switch to a window that is
	connected to a different server. Multi-server operview windows
	coming soon!

*** News 2003/12/07 -- New functions: $mods(), $loadedmods()
	These two functions are very straightforward. The $mods() function
	returns a space separated list of currently available modules
	and the $loadedmods() function returns a list of modules that are
	currently loaded. They do NOT call _build_modlist to scan for new
	modules.

*** News 2003/12/07 -- theme.dsm - /THEME -SAVE
	The /THEME command now has a -save option that will allow you to
	easily create themes from the current settings. This is the
	recommended way to create new themes, at least as a starting
	point.

*** News 2003/12/05 -- New command: /PURGEARRAY
	This works just like the other PURGE* commands except that it
	operates on arrays instead of ASSIGN variables. It will remove
	entire structures just like its counterparts.

*** News 2003/12/04 -- window.dsm - Auto-query changes
	The auto-query code has had many improvements (thanks to persistent
	pestering by larne) and should work much better now. During this
	rewrite, the AUTO_QUERY config variable was renamed AUTO_QUERY_WINDOW
	and a new config variable, named AUTO_QUERY_WINDOW_ARGS, was added.

*** News 2003/12/04 -- formats.dsm - New format variables
	I have applied a patch provided by larne that adds several new
	format variables. They are SET_AMBIGUOUS, SET_CHANGE, SET_HEADER,
	SET_FOOTER, TOPIC_HEADER[1|2], and TOPIC_FOOTER[1|2]. See the
	included themes for examples.

*** News 2003/12/02 -- New config variable: DOUBLE_STATUS
	There is a new config variable named DOUBLE_STATUS. It is responsible
	for toggling the DOUBLE status for all existing windows, as well
	as new windows, except those that have FIXED ON and SWAPPABLE OFF.

*** News 2003/12/02 -- theme.dsm - Arguments to TOPIC* formats changed
	The arguments passed to some of the TOPIC* format variables have
	changed. Please have a look at the included themes to see exactly
	what is different.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- nickmgr.dsm 0.2 - New command: /NICKMGR
	A new command, named /NICKMGR, has been added to provide an easier
	interface to modifying the NICKMGR_NICKLIST config variable. This
	is just like the /AUTOLOAD command.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- 005 aware aliases
	Several aliases (including /MASSMODE, /TBAN, and /WALL) now attempt
	to discover the max # of targets or modes to send in a single command
	by looking at the data provided by the 005 numeric.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- Format variables moved
	All of the standard formats (JOIN, PART, MSG, PUBLIC, etc.) have
	been moved from their respective modules to a new module named
	formats.dsm. This includes everything from names.dsm. All themes
	will have to be updated. The easiest way to do this is to manually
	load your old theme files and then use /THEME -SAVE to write
	a theme in the new format with these settings.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- New function: $visiblewins()
	This returns a list of the refnums of all currently visible windows.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- New function: $getitems()
	This function returns the values of a list of item numbers and/or
	range of numbers (e.g. 3-7) from an array. It takes an offset
	argument that will be added to each item number before it is
	retrieved, thus allowing you to map the real item numbers to
	any range of numbers. All non-numeric list arguments will simply
	be returned as is. See core/functions.dsc for details.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- New functions: $getdsets(), $getfsets()
	These functions work just like the builtin $getsets() function.
	They return a space separated list of the config or format
	variables that match the given pattern.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- New function: $chanvoice()
	There is a new function, donated by |Rain|, named $chanvoice().
	It returns a space separated list of nicks that are voiced in the
	specified (or current) channel.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- Add CrazyEddy's command queue system
	I have added the majority of CrazyEddy's command queue system to
	the core. This includes the /QCMD, /FQCMD, /Q1CMD, and /FQ1CMD
	aliases. See core/commands.dsc for details about their use.

*** News 2003/11/30 -- Major overhaul of the core scripts
	Large parts of the core scripts have been rewritten and many things
	have changed. The following is a partial list of these changes.

	* The SAVE_VERBOSE, LOADMODULE_VERBOSE, and AUTO_LOAD_PROMPT
	  (replaced by LOAD_PROMPT) config variables have been removed.

	* The /SAVE command has been rewritten and now allows modules
	  create special aliases (<modname>._save) that will be executed
	  automatically whenever the settings for that module are saved.
	  See modules/oper.dsm for an example of this in action.

	* The theme system has been moved out of the core and into a module
	  named theme.dsm. The status.dsc core script has also been removed
	  and all the statbar stuff is now part of the theme system.

	* The config.add and format.add aliases are now deprecated. Module
	  authors should use the new addconfig and addformat aliases instead.

	* A new command, named /AUTOLOAD, has been added to provide an easier
	  interface for modifying the module auto-load list.

	* The $bool_to_num() and $bool_to_onoff() functions have been renamed
	  to $bool2num() and $bool2word().
