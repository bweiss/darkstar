*** News 2003/11/10 -- oper.dsm 0.5 - Password support for challenge-response
	We now support password protected keys for challenge-response opering!
	Also, failed oper attempts (either with /OPER or /CHALLENGE) will
	cause the auto-challenge timer to ignore that server for 20 minutes.

*** News 2003/11/07 -- window.dsm 0.9 - Changed key bindings
	Several changes mostly related to key bindings, including:
	 * The Insert and Delete keys are now left alone to EPIC's defaults.
	 * Esc + PgUp/PgDn will now scroll the "last" window (according to
	   /WINDOW LAST). Most of the time this should be the last active
	   split window.
	 * The binding for the F12 key has also been changed so that it
	   clears the "last" window instead of just the msg window.
	 * Some hopefully unnecessary key bindings were removed so please
	   let me know if anything breaks.
	 * The AUTO_CREATE_WINDOWS feature should now play nicely with the
	   operview window provided by the oper module.

*** News 2003/11/06 -- channel.dsm 1.1 - New temp. ban aliases: /TEMP[BK|KB]
	There are two new temporary ban aliases: /TEMPBK and /TEMPKB. These
	are just like the /BK and /KB aliases except that the bans are
	placed with /TEMPBAN.

*** News 2003/11/04 -- New function: $winchannels()
	A $winchannels() function has been added to the core. This new
	function will return a space separated list of all the channels
	belonging to a specific window. This allows different actions to
	be taken depending on whether or not a window has multiple channels
	belonging to it. This could be very useful for themes.

*** News 2003/11/04 -- oper.dsm 0.4 - Take the oper challenge!
	I have added support for opering with the challenge-response feature
	present in ratbox servers and some hybrid7 servers. There are two
	new config variables used to control this: AUTO_CHALLENGE and
	CHALLENGE_RSA_RESPOND. The latter is the path to the rsa_respond
	binary required to generate the response. See ds:oper(3) for details.

	Note[1]: In order to use /CHALLENGE or AUTO_CHALLENGE, you must
	first add an entry to the challenge-response list for the server
	you wish to oper on. This can be accomplished using the -add option
	with /CHALLENGE.

	Note[2]: Currently this does not support the use of key files that
	are password protected, thus defeating most of the security gained
	through the use of challenge-response authentication. At the moment
	this is mostly suitable for use by people who run local test servers
	or small networks that don't require a lot of security. I do hope to
	support the use of passwords in the near future so watch this file
	for updates.

*** News 2003/11/02 -- Goodbye seen.dsm
	It has been brought to my attention that the seen module, which
	was never mentioned in this file, isn't really a very important
	feature and, considering how buggy it is, should not be included
	in the repository and official tar file. As of this point it will
	no longer be distributed with the DarkStar core but will be made
	available in the "Extra Modules" section of the website.


DarkStar 0.2.11 (20031101)


*** News 2003/10/31 -- misc.dsm 1.1 - ratbox ircd whois_actually support
	There is a new format variable for ratbox ircd's whois_actually
	feature (AKA realhost). The variable is called WHOIS_REALHOST.
	Theme authors will want to update their themes so that it does
	not mess up their whois output.

*** News 2003/10/31 -- oper.dsm - New config variable: OPERVIEW_LEVEL
	There is a new config variable to control the level of the
	operview window: OPERVIEW_LEVEL. This works just like the equivalent
	for the msg window in window.dsm.

*** News 2003/10/30 -- window.dsm 0.8 - Automatically create/destroy windows
	Support for automatically creating or destroying windows on
	join/part has been added. There are 3 new config variables used
	to control this feature: JOIN_NEW_WINDOW, JOIN_NEW_WINDOW_ARGS,
	and PART_KILL_WINDOW. See ds:window(3) for details.

*** News 2003/10/23 -- nickmgr.dsm 0.1 and keepnick no mo'
	Ahhh... At last we are rid of the cursed keepnick module.
	To replace it I have written a nick management module that
	should be a vast improvement. See ds:nickmgr(3) for details.

*** News 2003/09/21 -- misc.dsm 1.0 - New format variable: SIGNOFF
	There is a new format variable named SIGNOFF that will format the
	output of signoff messages. This variable will not be used if the
	channel module is loaded and CHANNEL_SIGNOFF has a value.

*** News 2003/09/21 -- channel.dsm 1.0 - /WALL Yay, /WALL2 Nay
	I finally fixed the /WALL alias and got rid of /WALL2. The method
	used for sending the NOTICEs will now be determined by the new
	config variable CHANNEL_WALL_TYPE. There are three possible types:
	   1 - Send a single NOTICE to @<channel>
	   2 - Send NOTICEs to all +o users, seven at a time
	   3 - Send NOTICEs one at a time (USE WITH CAUTION)

	Also, the ban list headers and footers (/FSET BAN) will now be
	displayed even if there are no bans on the channel. This is more
	consistent with the client's normal behavior and should make some
	of the mimic themes more authentic.


DarkStar 0.2.10 (20030915)


*** News 2003/09/10 -- tabkey.dsm 0.4 - Renamed variable / code cleanup
	The TABKEY_MAX_NICKHIST config variable has been renamed.
	It is now called TABKEY_MAX_MSG_HISTORY. I apologize for the
	change but this new name is a much better representation of
	its actual purpose.

	All completion methods (except tabkey.method.variable) now use
	the arguments given to them instead of taking what they need
	from $L. This is how completion methods were originally intended
	to work.

	Most aliases now use function_return instead of /RETURN in
	order to avoid potential problems caused by EPIC's auto-append
	feature.

*** News 2003/09/06 -- channel.dsm 0.8 - New alias: /ADDTOPIC
	There is a new alias called /ADDTOPIC that allows you to add
	a string of text to an existing topic separated by the value
	of the new ADDTOPIC_DELIMETER config variable.

*** News 2003/09/05 -- channel.dsm 0.7 - /[SET]OLDTOPIC renamed/improved
	The /OLDTOPIC and /SETOLDTOPIC aliases have been renamed to
	/SETTOPIC and /TOPICS. The channel module now keeps track of
	an arbitrary number of topics for each channel. The number of
	topics to be kept is determined by the REMEMBER_TOPICS config
	variable. See ds:channel(3) for details.

*** News 2003/09/05 -- New core command/function: /TLD, $tld()
	A /TLD alias has been added to take advantage of the new TLD
	structure. It works just like $country() in BitchX. See ds:tld(1)
	and ds:tld(2) for more details.

*** News 2003/09/05 -- New core script: globals.dsc
	This new script will contain miscellaneous global variables
	to be used by modules. Right now this just contains a list of
	current top-level domains. They can be accessed through the
	TLD structure.

*** News 2003/05/10 -- New module: memo.dsm
	This new module provides mechanisms to manipulate a text file
	of one-line memos from the client's input prompt. See ds:memo(3)
	for details.

*** News 2003/05/10 -- channel.dsm 0.6.4 - Auto-response notify
	I have added a new feature called auto-response notify. When
	enabled, it will echo a notification to the current window
	whenever auto-response is triggered in another window. It is
	controlled by the boolean config variable AUTO_RESPONSE_NOTIFY
	and is not enabled by default.

*** News 2003/03/05 -- oper.dsm 0.2 - operview window
	The oper module now includes an operview window similar to the
	msg window contained in the window module. This means we have
	three new config variables: OPERVIEW, OPERVIEW_HIDDEN, and
	OPERVIEW_SIZE.

	As a result, the default value for the MSG_WINDOW_LEVEL config
	variable has been changed from "msgs,opnotes,wallops" to "msgs".
	Anyone who uses both operview and the msg window will probably
	want to make this change in their saved settings as well.

*** News 2003/02/18 -- tabkey.dsm 0.3.4 - Improved filename handling
	I have merged CrazyEddy's recent changes to tabkey.ce that provide
	improved handling of "evil" filenames. Unfortunately this requires
	EPIC4-1.1.10 with a commit_id of 464 or higher to work properly.
	This means that those of you still using an older client will not
	be able to do filename completion with this module. If you do not
	wish to upgrade your client but can't live without filename
	completion, you can copy tabkey.dsm 0.3.3 from the 0.2.9 release
	to your "user directory" and it will override the one in $DS.HOME.


DarkStar 0.2.9 (20030212)


*** News 2002/10/14 -- window.dsm 0.7.1 - Auto-query changes
	A new config variable named AUTO_QUERY_UPDATE has been added
	to control whether existing queries are updated automatically
	on nick changes. This means that the existing AUTO_QUERY variable
	now only controls the initial creation of query windows for
	incoming private msgs. The code that handles both of these
	features should now also be safe for use with multiple server
	connections in a single client.

*** News 2002/10/07 -- misc.dsm 0.9 - New format variable: WHOIS_ADMIN
	Support for a new WHOIS numeric (308) has been added. This numeric
	is sent by Hybrid7 servers (and some modified Hyb6 servers) when
        the user being /WHOISed is an administrator.

*** News 2002/10/06 -- New, non-recursive /LESS
	The /LESS file pager has been rewritten so that it uses iteration
	instead of recursion and should now be safe to use within other
	aliases, as the client will now wait for the entire file to
	finish outputting before moving on to the next task.

*** News 2002/10/03 -- window.dsm 0.7 - Hidden msg window now supported
	There is a new boolean config variable named MSG_WINDOW_HIDDEN that,
	when true, will cause the msg window to be hidden instead of split.

*** News 2002/10/02 -- New tabkey module! (based on tabkey.ce)
	There is a completely new tabkey module based on CrazyEddy's
	tabkey.ce script that is distributed with EPIC4. This new module
	has a better design and provides quite a few advantages over
	the old one.

	Things that differ from the old module (for users):
	 - Cursor sensitive. Allows you to complete words anywhere on
	   the input line.
	 - Works with any value for $CMDCHARS.
	 - Cycles through possible matches when the user continues to
	   press the tab key.
	 - Support for /HELP and /DHELP completion.
	 - Support for /WINDOW completion.
	 - The TABKEY_NICK_HISTORY config variable has been renamed to
	   TABKEY_MAX_NICKHIST.
	 - No longer controlled by "completion rules".
	 - No /TABKEY alias.

*** News 2002/09/28 -- window.dsm 0.6 - /DSET AUTO_QUERY and /WQ
	A new boolean config variable named AUTO_QUERY has been added.
	When true, all incoming msgs will cause a hidden window to be created
	and a query to be started with the person who sent the msg. It will
	also automatically update any existing queries if the user changes
	their nick.

	An alias called /WQ has also been added. It works just like the /WJ
	alias except that it starts a query with its argument instead of
	joining a channel.


DarkStar 0.2.8 (20020918)


*** News 2002/09/17 -- oper.dsm 0.1.2 - New format variable: WALLOP
	All incoming wallops will now be formatted according to the value
	of the WALLOP format variable.

*** News 2002/09/17 -- channel.dsm 0.6.1 - New format variable: SEND_WALL
	The /WALL and /WALL2 aliases will now honor the SEND_WALL variable
	when formatting their output.

*** News 2002/09/07 -- /SAVE now writes custom status file
	The /SAVE alias provided by the core scripts (core/save.dsc) will
	now write a "custom" status file to your user directory.

*** News 2002/09/07 -- New theme: porphyria
	Added a new theme called porphyria that is being contributed by
	Daniel Shatter. It's a simple, single status theme with no high
	ASCII characters and great contrast. Very good.

*** News 2002/09/06 -- darkstar theme renamed to astral, epic4 new default
	I have renamed the darkstar theme to astral and the epic4 theme has
	become the new default. People currently using the darkstar theme
	will need to change to the new name, of course. I apologize for any
	inconvenience this causes but I feel this makes more sense and will
	also make things easier on me in the future.

*** News 2002/09/05 -- misc.dsm 0.7.8 - UnrealIRCd's WHOISBOT now supported
	Support for UnrealIRCd's WHOISBOT reply (numeric 335) has been added.
	This includes the addition of a new format variable called WHOIS_BOT,
	so please update your themes. :-)

*** News 2002/08/31 -- channel.dsm 0.5.7 / misc.dsm 0.7.7 - SEND_ACTION*
	The arguments being passed to the SEND_ACTION* format variables
	in the misc and channel modules have changed slightly so themes
	will need to be updated. The sender's nick (you) is now the
	first argument with the target and text of the action following
	that. Prior to this only the target and text were sent forcing
	$servernick() to be used in the actual format variables in order
	to display the nick of the sender. This is no longer the case and
	all themes should be modified to reflect this change.

*** News 2002/08/19 -- EPIC4-1.1.7 or higher now required
	Due mostly to the recent changes to /DEFER and EPIC's key binding
	system, versions of DarkStar after this date will now require
	EPIC4-1.1.7 in order to operate correctly. It is recommended that
	all users upgrade immediately so as to prevent any possible
	backdoors caused by the changes to /DEFER.

*** News 2002/07/25 -- nickcomp.dsm 1.0.3 - New config variable
	There is a new config variable in the nickcomp module called
	NICK_COMPLETION_THRESHOLD. It can be used to adjust the accuracy
	of the nick completion. Please consult the ds:nickcomp(3) help
	page for details.

*** News 2002/07/09 -- New function: $uh()
	I added the $uh() function from the guh script distributed with
	EPIC4 (written by Jeremy Nelson). This works just like $userhost()
	except it queries the server rather than trying to get the userhost
	from the client's cache.

*** News 2002/06/19 -- Changes to WHO in the darkstar and feedback themes
	The WHO format variable in the darkstar and feedback themes was not
	properly highlighting servers with 0 hops. In the process of fixing
	this I was also able to greatly simplify things. Anyone with a custom
	theme based off either of these themes should have a look at the
	changes and adjust their theme(s) accordingly.

*** News 2002/06/18 -- misc.dsm 0.7.4 - IGNORE_CTCP_FINGER fixed
	There was a typo in the raw_irc hook added at load time for
	IGNORE_CTCP_FINGER that caused FINGER requests to not be ignored
	when they should have been.

*** News 2002/06/11 -- channel.dsm 0.5.5 - New edit-topic alias: /etopic
	Added an alias called /etopic that will allow you to edit the
	current topic by placing it on the input line preceded by "/topic".
	The /tt and /ttopic aliases point to /etopic.


DarkStar 0.2.7 (20020610)


*** News 2002/06/09 -- tabkey.dsm 0.7.2
	The assign procedure has been renamed aliasctl and now handles
	completion for both assign variables and aliases. This will cause
	old rules that use the assign procedure to be rejected, so check
	your custom rules if you have any. Several new completion rules
	were also added to the defaults.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- New config variable: AUTO_SAVE_ON_UNLOAD
	The name says it all. It has a boolean value that, when true,
	will cause a module's settings to be saved before it is unloaded.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- VERBOSE_SAVE and VERBOSE_LOAD renamed
	The VERBOSE_SAVE and VERBOSE_LOAD config variables that are part
	of the core scripts have been renamed to SAVE_VERBOSE and
	LOADMODULE_VERBOSE.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- tabkey.dsm 0.7
	Changes include a /tabkey alias which provides an interface to
	modifying completion rules and replaces the /cleartab alias.
	While adding this, I also solved the annoying issues regarding
	rule #1 and the "" pattern.

*** News 2002/06/08 -- The ChangeLog is no more
	I have decided to do away with the ChangeLog, mostly because
	CVS already does a better job of tracking changes for me, and
	end users don't need to know the gory details. Instead, I will
	use this file called UPDATES to let people know about important
	changes without all the technical details. Yes, this is just
	like the file of the same name included with EPIC4 :-).
