# This is a sample rc file for EPIC. It just changes a few default settings
# to values that the average user will probably like better. It will also
# cause DarkStar to be loaded automatically on client startup.
#
# To use this file, simply copy it to ~/.epicrc or ~/.ircrc
#
# NOTE: Any aliases, assign variables, or hooks that are added in this file
# will be removed when darkstar.irc is loaded. If you wish to add these things
# it should be done as part of a module. See doc/modules.txt for a tutorial
# on writing DarkStar modules.
#

# In most EPIC builds the default level of window 1 is ALL, a setting
# that is usually undesirable for users that open multiple windows.

# The first window is often named "ircII" by default, uncomment the
# following to have this name removed.

# Change some default EPIC settings to more reasonable values.
