ABOUT

DarkStar is a modular script pack for the EPIC4 IRC client versions 1.1
and up. It is highly extensible and includes theme support, advanced tab
completion, and a whole bunch of other goodies. The modular design offers
many benefits (and a few drawbacks) and allows for a very high level of
customization.

Although still under heavy development, these scripts should be quite
usable and already provide most of the features people are accustomed to.
The documentation is still a bit scarce, so anyone looking to write their
own modules, themes, and status bars should contact me for help. Everyone
else should browse through the help files (located in the help/ directory)
by typing /DHELP at the EPIC4 input prompt after DarkStar has finished
loading.


REQUIREMENTS

The only requirement is EPIC4-1.1 or higher. This script pack will NOT
work with EPIC4-1.0. You have been warned.


WHERE TO GET DARKSTAR AND EPIC4

There is now an official DarkStar website, which can be found here:

  http://darkstar.epicsol.org/
  http://darkstar.nuthouse.org/  (mirror)

Recent versions of both DarkStar and EPIC4 can also be found at the
following URLs:

  http://www.epicsol.org/
  http://www.got.net/~brian/epic4/

A snapshot of my current tree (as well as EPIC) is also available via CVS:

  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@epicsol.org:/home/cvs/repository
  cvs login
  (Password is "anoncvs")
  cvs co darkstar

  (Or to checkout the latest EPIC4 tree...)
  cvs co epic4

Once you have done a checkout you can just do the following to update it.

  cd darkstar/     (or epic4/)
  cvs update -dP


GETTING STARTED

If you're the impatient type, it should be safe to just go ahead and
load darkstar.irc now. It should automatically detect its location and
set things up accordingly. Once loaded, you can use /DHELP to browse the
basic documentation.

There are a few things that get set at load time that you may want to
change. This can be accomplished by setting the following environment
variables.

    DARKSTAR_HOME - DarkStar home directory (default: ~/darkstar)
                    *** You are no longer required to set this if you
                    install somewhere other than the default. It will
                    now use $loadinfo() to determine the home directory.

      DARKSTAR_RC - Location of the rc file. This is loaded every time
                    darkstar.irc is loaded, including /RELOADs. This file
                    should be used for EPIC settings instead of ~/.epicrc,
                    so that it can be used to load darkstar.irc on startup.
                    (default: ~/.dsrc)

 DARKSTAR_USERDIR - Location of the "User directory". This just contains
                    directories where you can put your own modules, status
                    bars, and themes so they are not messed with when you
                    upgrade. Saved settings also go here by default.
                    (default: ~/.darkstar)

The way you set these variables depends on the shell that you are using.

(sh, bash, zsh, etc)

  export DARKSTAR_USERDIR=~/.epic4/darkstar

(*csh)

  setenv DARKSTAR_USERDIR ~/.epic4/darkstar

If you don't want to create these variables every time you login,
I recommend putting them in a shell startup script.
(~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.cshrc, etc.)

Nothing else is required to begin using DarkStar. However, I recommend
having a look at sample.dsrc in the main directory.

At this point you can just type "/LOAD /path/to/darkstar.irc" to begin
using the scripts. The available modules will be displayed and you will
be prompted about which ones to load. Just pushing enter will load all
modules on the Auto-Load list (/DSET AUTO_LOAD_MODULES).

If you would like to load DarkStar automatically on client startup,
you can place the following code in ~/.epicrc

  load /path/to/darkstar.irc

Once the script is loaded you can use /DHELP for further assistance.

That's it! I hope you find these scripts as useful as I do, and please
feel free to send me any feedback you might have.
