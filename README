ABOUT

Darkstar is a modular script pack written for use with EPIC4, specifically,
version 1.1.2 and up. It is intended mostly for advanced users that wish to
take the time to customize their client, but should remain quite usable for
less advanced users. What makes this script pack special is its modularity.
Included are a set of core scripts which provide everything necessary to
load/unload modules, configure settings, save settings, change statbars,
manage themes, and browse the help files. All other features come in the
form of modules that can be loaded or unloaded at any time. Not only does
this mean you only load the features you want, but more importantly, it
allows scripters to add their own features with ease.

Currently, only the basic user commands provided by the core scripts have
been documented. I do have plans to write more in-depth documentation at a
later time, but for now, if you are a scripter and are interested in writing
your own modules, themes, or status bars, please feel free to contact me.
As for users, the following should get you started.


WHERE TO GET DARKSTAR AND EPIC4

Darkstar and EPIC4 can be found at the following URLs:

http://www.got.net/~brian/
http://www.epicsol.org/

A snapshot of my current tree (as well as EPIC) is also available via CVS:

  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@epicsol.org:/home/cvs/repository
  cvs login
  (Password is "anoncvs")
  cvs co darkstar

  (Or to checkout the latest EPIC4 tree...)
  cvs co epic4

Once you have done a checkout you can just do the following to update it.

  cd darkstar/
  cvs update -dP


GETTING STARTED

The first thing that needs to be done in order to use Darkstar is to tell
the script where everything is located. This can be done through the setting
of the following environment variables...

NOTE: You do not need to do this if you are using the default locations.

  DARKSTAR_HOME - Darkstar home directory (default: ~/darkstar)
  DARKSTAR_RC - Location of the rc file. This is loaded every time darkstar.irc
		is loaded, including /RELOADs. (default: ~/.dsrc)
  DARKSTAR_USER - Location of the "User directory." This just contains
		  directories where you can put your own modules, status bars,
		  and themes. Saved settings also go here by default.
		  (default: ~/.darkstar)

This can be accomplished in the following ways (depending on your shell) ...

(sh, bash, zsh, etc)

  export DARKSTAR_HOME=~/.epic4/darkstar

(*csh)

  setenv DARKSTAR_HOME ~/.epic4/darkstar

If you don't want to create these variables every time you login, I recommend
putting them in a shell startup script. (~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile,
~/.zshrc, ~/.cshrc, etc.)

Nothing else is required to begin using Darkstar. However, I would recommend
having a look at sample.dsrc in the main directory. This file will be loaded
by default if DARKSTAR_RC is not set. If you're going to make changes to this


At this point you can just type /load /path/to/darkstar/darkstar.irc to
begin using the script. The available modules will be displayed and you
will be prompted about which ones to load. Just pushing enter will load all
modules on the Auto-Load list (/dset AUTO_LOAD_MODULES).

If you would like to load Darkstar automatically on client startup, you can
place the following code in ~/.ircrc (or ~/.epicrc if using epic4-1.1)

  if (epic() && !bitchx())
  {
	^load /path/to/darkstar/darkstar.irc
  }

Once the script is loaded you can use /dhelp for further assistance.

That's it! I hope you enjoy my script and please feel free to send me any
feedback you might have.
