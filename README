ABOUT

Darkstar is a modular script written for use with EPIC4, specifically,
version 1.0. It is intended mostly for advanced users that wish to
take the time to customize their client. The core script itself is quite
small and provides everything necessary to load/unload modules, configure
settings, save settings, change statbars, and browse the help files. All
other features come in the form of modules that can be loaded or unloaded
at any time. This gives the script great flexibility and power. I must
apologize for the lack of real documentation at this time, but the following
should be enough to get you started. The script is quite usable despite it
being in the early stages of development.


WHERE TO GET DARKSTAR AND EPIC4

Darkstar and EPIC4 can be obtained from the following places:

http://www.got.net/~brian/
http://www.neglected.net/~brian/
http://www.epicsol.org/~brian/

A snapshot of my current tree is also available via CVS:

	export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@epicsol.org:/home/cvs/repository
	cvs login
	(password is "anoncvs")
	cvs co darkstar

  Once you have done a checkout you can just do the following to update it.

	cd darkstar/
	cvs update

GETTING STARTED

The first thing that needs to be done in order to use Darkstar is to tell
the script where everything is located. This can be done through the setting
of the following environment variables...

NOTE: You do not need to do this if you are using the default locations.

  DARKSTAR_HOME - Darkstar home directory (default: ~/darkstar)
  DARKSTAR_RC - Location of the rc file. This is loaded every time darkstar.irc
		is loaded, including /RELOADs. (default: ~/.dsrc)
  DARKSTAR_USER - Location of the "User directory." This just contains
		  directories where you can put your own modules, status bars,
		  and themes. Saved settings also go here by default.
		  (default: ~/.darkstar)

This can be accomplished in the following ways (depending on your shell) ...

(sh, bash, zsh, etc)

  export DARKSTAR_HOME=~/.epic4/darkstar

(*csh)

  setenv DARKSTAR_HOME ~/.epic4/darkstar

If you don't want to create these variables every time you login, I recommend
putting them in a shell startup script. (~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile,
~/.zshrc, ~/.cshrc, etc.)

Nothing else is required to begin using Darkstar. However, I would recommend
having a look at sample.dsrc in the main directory. This file will be loaded
by default if DARKSTAR_RC is not set. If you're going to make changes to this
file, I would recommend moving it out of the Darkstar home directory so that
it does not get overwritten during upgrades. (If you move this file, you
must make DARKSTAR_RC point to its new location or it will continue to load
sample.dsrc).

*NOTE* The save directory should also be somewhere outside of Darkstar's main
directory to avoid it being overwritten during upgrades.

At this point you can just type /load /path/to/darkstar/darkstar.irc to
begin using the script. The available modules will be displayed and you
will be prompted about which ones to load. Just pushing enter will load all
modules on the Auto-Load list (/dset AUTO_LOAD_MODULES).

If you would like to load Darkstar automatically on client startup, you can
place the following code in ~/.ircrc ...

  if (epic() && !bitchx())
  {
	^load /path/to/darkstar/darkstar.irc
  }

Once the script is loaded you can use /dhelp for further assistance.

That's it! I hope you enjoy my script and please feel free to contact me with
bug reports, code, or suggestions.
