ABOUT

Darkstar is a modular script pack for EPIC4 aimed at being highly extensible
and well written. It consists of two main parts.

1. A set of core scripts which provides a module loader, config manager,
help browser, some generally useful commands and functions, and a way to
save settings.

2. Various modules that add most of the features everyone is used to,
including: an away system, advanced tab key completion, improved window
management, nick completion, and other things to make the client comfortable.
These modules are completely independent of each other (though dependencies
are supported) and can be loaded or unloaded at any time. These modules
are mostly made up of scripts that I was using before this project.

The current state of this project is:
  Core scripts: Beta, but stable. Still subject to change. End user commands
		have been documented.
  Modules: Beta, but stable. Still subject to change. Documented.

Contributors are welcomed! If you would like to get involved with this
project in any way, please don't hesitate to contact me.


WHERE TO GET DARKSTAR AND EPIC4

Recent versions of both Darkstar and EPIC4 can be found at the
following URLs:

  http://www.got.net/~brian/epic4/scripts/darkstar/
  http://www.epicsol.org/

A snapshot of my current tree (as well as EPIC) is also available via CVS:

  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@epicsol.org:/home/cvs/repository
  cvs login
  (Password is "anoncvs")
  cvs co darkstar

  (Or to checkout the latest EPIC4 tree...)
  cvs co epic4

Once you have done a checkout you can just do the following to update it.

  cd darkstar/
  cvs update -dP


GETTING STARTED

The first thing that needs to be done in order to use Darkstar is to tell
the script where everything is located. This can be done through the setting
of the following environment variables...

NOTE: You do not need to do this if you are using the default locations.

  DARKSTAR_HOME - Darkstar home directory (default: ~/darkstar)

  DARKSTAR_RC - Location of the rc file. This is loaded every time darkstar.irc
		is loaded, including /RELOADs. This should be used for EPIC
		settings in place of ~/.epicrc. This frees ~/.epicrc up to
		load darkstar.irc on startup. (default: ~/.dsrc)

  DARKSTAR_USER - Location of the "User directory." This just contains
		  directories where you can put your own modules, status bars,
		  and themes so they are not messed with when you upgrade.
		  Saved settings also go here by default. (default: ~/.darkstar)

This can be accomplished in the following ways (depending on your shell) ...

(sh, bash, zsh, etc)

  export DARKSTAR_HOME=~/.epic4/darkstar

(*csh)

  setenv DARKSTAR_HOME ~/.epic4/darkstar

If you don't want to create these variables every time you login, I recommend
putting them in a shell startup script. (~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile,
~/.zshrc, ~/.cshrc, etc.)

Nothing else is required to begin using Darkstar. However, I would recommend
having a look at sample.dsrc in the main directory.

At this point you can just type '/load /path/to/darkstar.irc' to begin
using the script. The available modules will be displayed and you will be
prompted about which ones to load. Just pushing enter will load all modules
on the Auto-Load list (/dset AUTO_LOAD_MODULES).

If you would like to load Darkstar automatically on client startup, you can
place the following code in ~/.epicrc

  load /path/to/darkstar.irc

Once the script is loaded you can use /dhelp for further assistance.

That's it! I hope you enjoy my scripts and please feel free to send me any
feedback you might have.
