ABOUT

DarkStar is a modular script pack and scripting framework for the EPIC5
IRC client. It is highly extensible and includes a module loading system,
theme support, advanced tab completion, nick management and more. The
modular design offers many benefits and allows for a very high level of
customization. While it has been designed with power users and other
scripters in mind, it still provides a nice environment for all types
of users right out of the box.


REQUIREMENTS

The only requirement is EPIC5-0.3 or higher. This script pack will NOT
work correctly with EPIC4 or older clients. You have been warned.

EPIC5-1.1.2 is the latest version of EPIC5 at this time. It is recommended
that all users run this version.


WHERE TO GET DARKSTAR AND EPIC5

There is now an official DarkStar website. You can find it at one of
the following locations.

  http://darkstar.epicsol.org/
  http://darkstar.prbh.org/

Recent versions of both DarkStar and EPIC5 can also be found at the
following URLs:

  http://www.epicsol.org/
  http://www.epicsol.org/~brian/

A snapshot of my current tree (as well as EPIC) is also available via CVS:

  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@epicsol.org:/home/cvs/repository
  cvs login
  (Password is "anoncvs")
  cvs co darkstar

  (or to checkout the latest EPIC5 tree...)
  cvs co epic5

Once you have done a checkout you can just do the following to update it.

  cd darkstar/     (or epic5/)
  cvs update -dP


GETTING STARTED

If you're the impatient type, it should be safe to just go ahead and
load darkstar.irc now. It should automatically detect its location and
set things up accordingly.

There are a few things that get set at load time that you may want to
change. This can be accomplished by setting the following environment
variables.

    DARKSTAR_HOME - DarkStar home directory (default: ~/darkstar)
                    *** You are no longer required to set this if you
                    install somewhere other than the default. It will
                    now use $loadinfo() to determine the home directory.

      DARKSTAR_RC - Location of the RC file. This is loaded every time
                    darkstar.irc is loaded, including /RELOADs. This file
                    should be used for EPIC settings instead of ~/.epicrc,
                    so that ~/.epicrc it can be used to load darkstar.irc
                    on startup. (default: ~/.dsrc)

 DARKSTAR_USERDIR - Location of the "User directory". This just contains
                    directories where you can put your own modules, status
                    bars, and themes so they are not messed with when you
                    upgrade. Saved settings also go here by default.
                    (default: ~/.darkstar)

The way you set these variables depends on the shell that you are using.

(sh, bash, zsh, etc)

  export DARKSTAR_USERDIR=~/.epic5/darkstar

(*csh)

  setenv DARKSTAR_USERDIR ~/.epic5/darkstar

If you don't want to create these variables every time you login,
I recommend putting them in a shell startup script.
(~/.bash_profile, ~/.profile, ~/.zshrc, ~/.cshrc, etc.)

Nothing else is required to begin using DarkStar. However, I recommend
having a look at sample.epicrc in the main directory.

At this point you can just type "/LOAD /path/to/darkstar.irc" from the EPIC
input prompt to begin using the scripts. A number of modules will be
loaded by default (changed via /DSET AUTO_LOAD_MODULES) and you should
be prompted to choose a theme. After that you may want to browse some of
the files located in the help/ directory within the main DarkStar directory.

If you would like to load DarkStar automatically on client startup,
you can place the following code in ~/.epicrc

  load /path/to/darkstar.irc

That's it! I hope you find these scripts as useful as I do, and please
feel free to send me any feedback you might have.
