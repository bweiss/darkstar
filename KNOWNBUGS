<none>

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Remove takbkey.cmd.mhelp; /MHELP was removed in a previous commit.
* Fix /MASSMODE
* Make sure to reset the value of extractw when exiting tabkey.main early.
* Remove $serverrefs() and replace all calls to it with calls to $myservers().
* Make sure window.msgwin.show only operates on windows that actually exist.
* Use global vars to keep track of boolean config vars, instead of an array.
* Require EPIC4-2.0 or higher.
* Keep the list of config/format variables belonging to each module (used by
  /SAVE) in arrays instead of assign variables. This will hopefully fix that
  pesky bug that was causing certain settings to not get saved.
* Change the way msg windows are named from msgs/serv:<#> to msgs/<#>
* Fix missing semi-colons in /TIG alias.
* Make sure to $encode() any server refnums that are being used in /ASSIGN
  variable names.
* Prevent nickmgr.nickchange from sending more than one request at a time
  to a server.
* Add a MSG_WINDOW_LEVEL config variable.
* Make /TBAN support comma delimited lists of ban numbers.
* Add context sensitive completion alias for /IG (tabkey.cmd.ig)
* Fix /THEME -SAVE
* Add a SIGNOFF format to all themes.
* Fix the default SEND_WALL format (also in epic4 theme).
* Add a SERVER_NOTICE format variable.
* Add YELL hook to suppress the annoying getaddrinfo() messages.
