THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Added /INSPECTARRAY to debug module.
* Added BlackJac's newnick script from EPIC5 (requested by Kanan)
* Added /DSET TABKEY_MSGHIST_SENT_ONLY to tabkey module (requested by Kanan)
* Added /FREE and /HOLD aliases to window module (requested by Kanan)
* Added /RE alias to misc module (requested by Kanan)
* Added /DSET AWAY_LOG_ALWAYS (boolean) to away module (requested by Kanan)
* Attempt to load dsrc file after modules load instead of before
* Fix tab comp for /WHOIS - call $tabkey.method.nick() only
* Removed the calls to $tabkey.method.chan() in the nickchan and
  nickchannotify methods. Instead we do our own channel matching in those
  methods to avoid the # and & prefixes being added automatically. This
  fixes a bug where mixed lists of channels and nicks were being returned
  to tabkey.main and causing the call to $prefix() to return no results.
  (Discovered by CrazyEddy)
* Moved msg handler out of tabkey.default and into tabkey.main.
* Defer call to formats.echo in send_msg hook in formats.dsm. This fixes a
  bug with the auto_query_window feature in window.dsm in which the sent msg
  would display in the current window before the new query window was
  created.
* Fix /TBAN when removing more than 4 bans.
* Added /WSB and /WSF aliases for /WINDOW SEARCH_{BACK|FORWARD}
