DarkStar Projects, Bugs, and other Errata:

KNOWN ERRATA (eg, bugs, or unresolved requests):
------------------------------------------------
* Important metadata required for /SAVE is mysteriously being removed.

THE CHANGELOG SINCE THE LAST RELEASE:
-------------------------------------
* Remove takbkey.cmd.mhelp; /MHELP was removed in a previous commit.
* Fix /MASSMODE
* Make sure to reset the value of extractw when exiting tabkey.main early.
* Remove $serverrefs() and replace all calls to it with calls to $myservers().
* Make sure window.msgwin.show only operates on windows that actually exist.
* Use global vars to keep track of boolean config vars, instead of an array.
* Require EPIC4-2.0 or higher.
* Keep the list of config/format variables belonging to each module (used by
  /SAVE) in arrays instead of assign variables. This will hopefully fix that
  pesky bug that was causing certain settings to not get saved.
