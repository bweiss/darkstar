* Trivia module (maybe)
* Relay module (/relm, /reln, etc)
* /scano, /scann, /scani
* Logging module
* Userlist module
* Flood protection module
* Auto-join
* XDCC module
* /cycle changes:
	<RoboHak> fudd: you could register a channel to be rejoined
		  and //part, then in the on leave check if it needs
		  to be rejoined
	<hop> fudd: the thing is that a "current channel" is created when a
	      "waiting channel" is JOINed
	<hop> fudd: a "waiting channel" is created when you /window channel
	      (ie, /join)
	<hop> thus, the fundamental problem occurs when you /quote join a
	      channel and when the JOIN comes back you are in a window that
	      has no channel
	<hop> epic puts it there
	<hop> but it isnt made current ecuase that window isn;t waiting for
	      it to be made current
	<hop> ponder this for a minute
	<hop> you're ni a window with two channels
	<hop> and you do thje /quote part and /quote join
	<hop> the "other" channel is the current channel when that PART comes
	      back
	<hop> but the /quote join doesn't change the current channel
	<hop> so /cycle on a two0-channel window "switches": the current channel
	<hop> just to warn you about that.
	<fudd> using an /on leave might solve all this
	<fudd> like robohak said
	<RoboHak> well, that would cause a non-current channel that's cycle'd
		  to become current

* Tabkey completion:
<wd> i.e. for ctcp you might have 'a.completion.add(ctcp %[,]c,N %'ping,
      version,time,utc,userinfo,clientinfo')
<wd> will complete the second argument of ctcp using the list of current
      channels and current known nicknames, which can be comma separated
<wd> er, s/second/first
<wd> and the second argument based on that list of commands

[11:55] .BlackJac[blackjac@union.cavalry.net] Maybe you can make it work with
         /relt
[11:56] .msg[BlackJac] well, that wouldnt be a bad idea either.. but we might
         want them to be separate features
[11:56] .msg[BlackJac] it would be nice to be able to re-set old topics
         without having the relay module loaded
