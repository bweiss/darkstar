WORKS IN PROGRESS:

* Documentation
* XDCC/fserve module
* Userlist module


PLANNED FOR FUTURE:

* Channel protection module
* Auto-join
* URL grab module
* Rewrite keepnick.dsm
* /MEMO command


OTHER NOTES/IDEAS:

* Improved dependency support. We should keep track of what depends on what
  and take the proper actions on load/unload.
     - or -
  Remove dependency support altogether. Is it needed or is it just bloat?

* Honor the DISPLAY variable in format related /ON hooks?

* Figure out a way to allow modules to prevent output from /DSET (and /FSET?)
  from within /ON hooks.

* Look into taking advantage of the 005 numeric.
