FOR 0.3 RELEASE:

  * Add timestamping functionality to the core. This includes a TIMESTAMP
    config variable, a format variable of the same name, and a $ts() function
    for use in themes.

  * Write a new_users help page for /DHELP

  * Add a function that will return the nicks of all normal users (no ops,
    no half-ops, no voice) in a specified channel. This is needed because
    $nochops() returns voiced users along with the normal ones.

  * Add support for half-ops. Bleh.

  * Update help files and write better module documentation (doc/modules.txt)

  * Add some sort of function to return a list of all the channels that you
    and the specified nick are both joined to. Maybe something like
    $commonchans() or $sharedchans()?

  * Add /ALLKICK and /ALLBAN aliases.

  * Add auto-response formats for actions.

  * Rename the auto-response feature to something more sensible? Maybe
    "highlight" or "public highlight".


AFTER 0.3 RELEASE:

  * Add support for "paste mode" either as a module or as part of the core.

  * Add support for a topic bar.

  * Write a log management module. It should provide basic log management,   
    such as setting up automatic logging for various things (channels, nicks,
    windows, etc.) as well as log rotation features.

  * [misc.dsm] Add a server ping command (/SPING).

  * [memo.dsm] Add the ability to group memos.

  * [channel.dsm] The REMEMBER_TOPICS feature should also store the nick
    of the person that set the topic as well as the timestamp for it.   

  * Write a userlist module.

  * Use the new dcc_activity hook to write a %D workalike with a configurable
    delay so that it can be used over slower net connections.

  * Add formats for UltimateIRCd's 615 and 616 numerics (WHOIS)
    615 fudd : is using modes +ix +
    616 fudd : real hostname nuthouse.org 216.254.103.18

  * Add support for a random kick msg file like what BX has.

  * Rewrite the /JOIN and /LEAVE aliases so that they use the CHANTYPES
    parameter from the 005 numeric to determine the allowed channel prefixes.


OTHER NOTES/IDEAS:

  * Honor the DISPLAY variable in format related /ON hooks?

  * Figure out a way to allow modules to prevent output from /DSET (and /FSET?)
    from within /ON hooks.

  * Would some kind of generic caching system be useful? Features like
    REMEMBER_TOPICS and auto-query could use it instead of each having to
    handle caching things themselves.
