WORKS IN PROGRESS:

* Documentation
* XDCC/fserve module
* Userlist module


PLANNED FOR FUTURE:

* Channel protection module
* Auto-join
* URL grab module


OTHER NOTES/IDEAS:

* Improved dependency support. We should keep track of what depends on what
  and take the proper actions on load/unload.
     - or -
  Remove dependency support altogether. Is it needed or is it just bloat?

* tabkey.dsm:
[17:26] .whitefang[thall@epicsol.org] a<tab>
[17:27] .whitefang[thall@epicsol.org] it shows the matches, thats fine.
[17:27] .whitefang[thall@epicsol.org] but if you press it again, it should
         start cycling through

* Honor the DISPLAY variable in format related /ON hooks?
