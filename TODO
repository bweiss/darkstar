TODO:

  * Multi-server operview.

  * Make NAMES formatting in formats.dsm use /ON NAMES instead of hooking
    numerics directly.

  * Incorporate CrazyEddy's CEOP script.

  * Add some sort of function to return a list of all the channels that you
    and the specified nick are both joined to. Maybe something like
    $commonchans() or $sharedchans()?

  * Add /ALLKICK and /ALLBAN aliases.

  * Add /PASTE and possibly some sort of "paste mode" where all input would
    be sent to the current target regardless of it being prefixed by the
    value of /SET CMDCHARS.

  * Write a log management module. It should provide basic log management,
    such as setting up automatic logging for various things (channels, nicks,
    windows, etc.) as well as log rotation features.

  * [misc.dsm] Add a server ping command (/SPING).

  * [memo.dsm] Add the ability to group memos.

  * [channel.dsm] The REMEMBER_TOPICS feature should also store the nick
    of the person that set the topic as well as the timestamp for it.

  * Write a userlist module.

  * Use the new dcc_activity hook to write a %D workalike with a configurable
    delay so that it can be used over slower net connections.

  * Add formats for UltimateIRCd's 615 and 616 numerics (WHOIS)
    615 fudd : is using modes +ix +
    616 fudd : real hostname nuthouse.org 216.254.103.18

  * Add support for a random kick msg file.

  * Rewrite the /JOIN and /LEAVE aliases so that they use the CHANTYPES
    parameter from the 005 numeric to determine the allowed channel prefixes.

  * Write a server management module.

  * Incorporate howl's new /HELP script to prepare for the migration to EPIC5.

  * Incorporate BlackJac's history script to prepare for EPIC5.

  * Write a more flexible version of STATUS_NOTIFY (%F).


OTHER NOTES/IDEAS:

  * Honor the DISPLAY variable in format related /ON hooks?

  * Figure out a way to allow modules to prevent output from /DSET (and /FSET?)
    from within /ON hooks.

  * Would some kind of generic caching system be useful? Features like
    REMEMBER_TOPICS and auto-query could use it instead of each having to
    handle caching things themselves.
