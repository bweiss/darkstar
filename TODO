FOR 0.3 RELEASE:

 Core Scripts:

  * Write a $numlines() function that will return the number of lines
    that a given string will occupy after final display. This must take
    into account the effects of /SET [CONTINUED_LINE|INDENT].

  * Using the above mentioned $numlines() function, rewrite /LESS so that
    it correctly handles linewrapped output.

  * Move all (most?) aliases and assigns in the core scripts to the DS
    or CORE structures and make sure that the module loader does not allow
    any modules to use names that may interfere with the core scripts.
    This includes the words: ds, core, config, format, module, dset, fset,
    status (this may go away), and any others I'm forgetting.

  * Move certain key bindings (most importantly, pgup/pgdn) out of
    window.dsm and into the core.

  * Merge all the statbar stuff into themes. There isn't enough reason to
    keep these separate.

  * Overhaul /SAVE.

  * Add the option to have the module loader automatically purge non-existent
    modules from the auto-load list. This could take the form of either a
    /DSET option or the user could just be prompted every time.

  * Add 005 handler.

  * Add a DarkStar echo prefix? e.g. "*** DarkStar: Loaded module: foo 1.0"

  * $STATUS.DOUBLE and the single_status array are part of a miserable hack
    that needs to go away. Find some other way to do this.

  * Add timestamping functionality to the core. This includes a TIMESTAMP
    config variable, a format variable of the same name, and a $ts function
    for use in themes.

  * Rename the bool_to_* functions? $booltoword() and $booltonum()?

 Modules:

  * [memo.dsm] Add the ability to group memos.

  * [channel.dsm] The REMEMBER_TOPICS feature should also store the nick
    of the person that set the topic as well as the timestamp for it.

  * [window.dsm] Rename the BIND_ON_JOIN and UNBIND_ON_PART config variables?

  * Write a log management module. It should provide basic log management,
    such as setting up automatic logging for various things (channels, nicks,
    windows, etc.) as well as log rotation features.

  * [dcc.dsm] Add more DCC related formats.

  * [dcc.dsm] Figure out a good way to suppress the huge warning message
    that is displayed when resuming DCC transfers.

  * [misc.dsm] Add a server ping command (/SPING).


AFTER 0.3 RELEASE:

  * If possible, make all scripts safe for multi-server use.

  * [channel.dsm] Rewrite /WALL so that type 3 attempts to use the 005
    handler's value for MAXTARGETS or fallback to 4, instead of 7, if that
    fails.


OTHER NOTES/IDEAS:

* Improved dependency support. We should keep track of what depends on what
  and take the proper actions on load/unload.
     - or -
  Remove dependency support altogether. Is it needed or is it just bloat?

* Honor the DISPLAY variable in format related /ON hooks?

* Figure out a way to allow modules to prevent output from /DSET (and /FSET?)
  from within /ON hooks.
