Darkstar Frequently Asked Questions
$Id$

This is a work in progress and is in no particular order. It will be updated
as questions come up. Eventually, I may organize it, but don't count on it ;)


Q: What should I do when upgrading to new versions of darkstar?

A: This depends heavily on the amount of customization you do. If you have
   your own modules, themes, statbars, etc. then you need to be more
   concerned with changes to what I distribute. In this situation I strongly
   urge that you review the ChangeLog for details on what's new.

   If you don't write any of your own scripts for Darkstar then you don't
   need to worry so much. One cool thing about the way I designed things is
   that you don't always need to reload everything. If you know that the
   changes lie only in a specific module, you can reload just that module
   (/reloadmod). Same thing applies to themes (just set your theme again
   with /theme) and status bars (/status). The only time you need to reload
   the entire system (/reload) is when there have been changes to the
   core scripts (darkstar.irc and everything in the core directory). When
   this is the case, the value of DS.COMMIT_ID (darkstar.irc) will be
   incremented. This number being higher does not necessarily mean that
   a full reload is required in order to make use of changes in other things,
   it just means that something in the core scripts has changed. The only
   way to know for sure is to check the ChangeLog. If you don't want to
   worry about it at all, just always use /reload and you'll be fine.

Q: The 'darkstar' status bar is displaying letters with accents instead of
   straight lines. How can I fix this?

A: You need a font that displays these upper ASCII characters correctly.
   Any of the vga fonts should work. I have two of the vga fonts available
   at http://www.got.net/~brian/fonts/ and you can probably find others
   with a quick search on google.

   If you're using a font that you know works and you still can't get the
   lines to display correctly, you can try entering the following command
   at the EPIC input prompt.

     /eval xecho -r $chr(27)\(U

   If this works for you, you can place this command in ~/.epicrc so that
   it executes on startup.

Q: How can I set a default status bar?

A: The status bar is chosen by your theme. If you want to change the status
   bar that your theme uses, I would recommend creating a new theme based
   on your current theme which uses the different statbar. This way you won't
   lose your changes during upgrades. You can follow the directions in
   the answer of the following question to create a theme.

Q: How can I create my own theme?

A: Creating your own theme is fairly easy. Just follow these steps.

   (A '%' at the beginning of a line means to enter the command at your
   shell prompt.)

   1. Set the theme you want to start from with /theme
   2. Set the status bar you want to use with /status
   3. Change whatever /fset variables you want to be different.
   3. Type "/save" to save all your settings and write the "custom" theme.
   6. % cd ~/.darkstar/themes/
      (this is your "user directory", adjust if necessary)
   7. % cp -R custom/ <new_name>
   8. Type "/theme <new_name>" to begin using your new theme.
   9. You may want to /save again so that this theme is used on startup.

   Note: Only the settings for currently loaded modules are saved, so it is
         a good idea if you load all the modules you expect to use before
         creating your theme.
