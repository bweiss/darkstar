DarkStar Frequently Asked Questions
$Id$

This is a work in progress and is in no particular order. It will be
updated as questions come up. Eventually, I will write a better, more
organized version. For now, this will have to do.


Q: How can I make DarkStar load the modules I want on startup without
   asking me first?

A: First you may want to edit the list of modules that will be loaded
   automatically. You can do this by typing '/DSET AUTO_LOAD_MODULES'.
   When this is to your liking, type the following commands.

   /DSET AUTO_LOAD_PROMPT OFF
   /SAVE

Q: What should I do when upgrading to new versions of DarkStar?

A: This depends heavily on the amount of customization you do. If you have
   your own modules, themes, statbars, etc. then you need to be more
   concerned with changes to what I distribute. In this situation I strongly
   urge that you review the UPDATES file for details on what's new.

   If you don't write any of your own scripts for DarkStar then you don't
   need to worry so much. One cool thing is that you don't always need to
   reload everything. If you know that the changes lie only in a specific
   module, you can reload just that module (/RELOADMOD). Same thing applies
   to themes (just set your theme again with /THEME) and status bars (/STATUS).
   The only time you need to reload the entire system (/RELOAD) is when there
   have been changes to the core scripts (darkstar.irc and everything in the
   core directory). When this is the case, the value of DS.CORE_ID
   (darkstar.irc) will be incremented. This number being higher does not
   necessarily mean that a full reload is required in order to make use of
   changes in other things, it just means that something in the core scripts
   has changed. The only way to know for sure is to check the UPDATES file.
   If you don't want to worry about it at all, just always use /RELOAD and
   you'll be fine.

Q: My status bar is displaying letters with accents instead of straight lines.
   How can I fix this?

A: You need a font that displays these upper ASCII characters correctly.
   Any of the vga fonts should work. I have two of the vga fonts available
   at http://www.got.net/~brian/fonts/ and http://www.epicsol.org/~brian/.
   You can probably find others with a quick search on google.

   If you're using a font that you know works and you still can't get the
   lines to display correctly, you can try entering the following command
   at the EPIC input prompt.

     /EVAL XECHO -r $chr(27)\(U

   If this works for you, you can place this command in ~/.epicrc so that
   it executes on startup.

Q: How can I set a default status bar?

A: The status bar is chosen by your theme. If you want to change the status
   bar that your theme uses, I would recommend creating a new theme based
   on your current theme which uses the different statbar. This way you won't
   lose your changes during upgrades. You can follow the directions in
   the answer of the following question to create a theme.

Q: How can I create my own theme?

A: All you need to do in order to create your own theme (from one of the
   existing themes) is to copy that theme's directory over to your
   "user directory" and rename it. The name of the directory will be used
   as the name of the theme and will be available immediately without any
   kind of reload.

   e.g.
   % cd darkstar/themes/
   % cp -R astral ~/.darkstar/themes/mytheme

   The /SAVE command provided by the core scripts also writes the current
   theme and status bar settings to the "custom" theme. Combined with
   a little help from the tabkey module this makes it easy to edit/create
   themes at the EPIC input prompt. (The tabkey module can be used to
   complete commands, and even variable names and their values.)

Q: How can I get publics to show '@' and '+' before the nicks of users who
   are oped/voiced?

A: This can be accomplished by adding a small piece of code to the
   PUBLIC* (and optionally SEND_PUBLIC*) format variables wherever you
   want the '@' or '+' to be displayed.

   ${ischanop($1 $2) ? [@] : ischanvoice($1 $2) == 1 ? [+] : [ ]}

   e.g.
   *** Current value of PUBLIC is <$1> $3-
   /FSET PUBLIC <${ischanop($1 $2) ? [@] : ischanvoice($1 $2) == 1 ? [+] : [ ]}$1> $3-

   If you do this, you will probably want to create your own custom theme
   for it so that any changes you make are not overwritten the next time
   you update DarkStar. See the above question about creating your own theme
   for help with this.

Q: How can I add a timestamp to output?

A: There are currently two ways to add a timestamp to output. The easiest,
   which adds a timestamp to every line, is to do the following.

   /SET OUTPUT_REWRITE [$Z] $1-

   If you want to add a timestamp only to specific output, you should
   add $Z to any /FSET variables that you want to be timestamped.
