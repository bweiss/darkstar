Darkstar/EPIC4 Frequently Asked Questions

This is a work in progress. I will update it as questions arise. If you have
a question you feel should be here, please drop me an email.


Q: The 'darkstar' status bar is displaying letters with accents instead of
   straight lines. How can I fix this?

A: You need a font that displays these upper ASCII characters correctly.
   Any of the vga fonts should work. I have two of the vga fonts available
   at http://www.got.net/~brian/fonts/ and you can probably find others
   with a quick search on google.

   If you're using a font that you know works and you still can't get the
   lines to display correctly, you can try entering the following command
   at the EPIC input prompt.

     /eval xecho -r $chr(27)\(U

   If this works for you, you can place this command in ~/.epicrc so that
   it executes on startup.


Q: How can I set a default status bar?

A: The status bar is chosen by your theme. If you want to change the status
   bar that your theme uses, I would recommend creating a new theme based
   on your current theme which uses the different statbar. This way you won't
   lose your changes during upgrades. You can follow the directions in
   the answer of the following question to create a theme.


Q: How can I create my own theme?

A: Creating your own theme is fairly easy. Just follow these steps.

   (A '%' at the beginning of a line means to enter the command at your
   shell prompt.)

   1. Set the theme you want to start from with /theme
   2. Set the status bar you want to use with /status
   3. Change whatever /fset variables you want to be different.
   3. Type "/save" to save all your settings and write the "custom" theme.
   6. % cd ~/.darkstar/themes/
      (this is your "user directory", adjust if necessary)
   7. % cp -R custom/ <new_name>
   8. Type "/theme <new_name>" to begin using your new theme.
   9. You may want to /save again so that this theme is used on startup.
