Guide to the DarkStar module loading system.
$Id$

This intends to document the DarkStar module loading system as well as
explain methods for writing high quality modules. It is geared towards
people with some experience in ircII-EPIC scripting that are looking to
write their own modules or are just interested in understanding the
DarkStar core scripts. Note: This script pack is still under heavy
development and I make no guarantees about any of this being consistent
between versions.

What is a DarkStar module? Well, in its simplest form, it's just like any
other script that you might /LOAD but follows certain conventions in order
to take advantage of features provided by the DarkStar core. One of the most
important conventions these modules follow is the use of what I am calling
a cleanup queue. A cleanup queue is a special block of code that gets passed
to the /QUEUE command that will be executed whenever your module is unloaded
from the system. This cleanup queue is responsible for removing certain
pieces of code when the module is unloaded. This is needed because of the
fact that the module loader has no way to reliably keep track of everything
the module adds, so certain things must be specified for removal by the
module itself. I hope to remedy this as soon as it becomes possible to do
so. For now, this is something we're stuck with.

Technically, the only thing required to make a script available as a
DarkStar module is to place it in one of the module directories with
a ".dsm" extension. Of course, the module won't unload properly but that's
all that needs to happen in order for your script to show up in the list
of modules.

Nothing else needs to be done in order for a script to become a DarkStar
module. However, there are a variety of features provided by the core
scripts that module authors may want to take advantage of. There are also
a number of conventions you can follow that will make your code easier to
manage as well as ensuring that it plays nice with any other modules that
other people may write. I will go into detail about some of these, as well
as the cleanup queue, in the comments of the example module below.

Limitations on modules:

  - The module's name can only contain characters that are valid as
    /ASSIGN variable names. This is because much of the data about the
    module will be stored in ASSIGN structures named after the module.

  - The following module names are reserved for use by the core scripts:
    core, ds, module, config, format, and anything beginning with an
    underscore (e.g. _foo). Attempting to name a module one of these words
    will result in an error and the module will not be present in the
    modlist.


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT PF LOADER ***

Current versions of DarkStar utilize the PF loader (pre-formatted) for
all core scripts and modules. This has many implications for your scripts
so only enable the PF loader if you know what this is. This can be enabled
by putting "loader:pf" at the top of your module (see below).

The example module below was written using the std loader. For examples
of modules using the PF loader see the modules directory.

--- START OF FILE: sample.dsm ---
# version:0.1.3 loader:std
#
# The above line is called a module header and is read by the module loader
# (/LOAD sees it as a comment) when it scans for modules. This header gives
# the loader information about the module. Currently only two header tags
# are supported: version and loader. The 'version' tag, as its name implies,
# gives the loader a version string to be displayed in the modlist. The
# 'loader' tag allows module authors to specify whether they would like to
# use EPIC's standard loader (std) or the new pre-formatted loader (pf).
# See epic4/doc/pf-loader for details about this wonderful /LOAD option.
# NOTE: As of DarkStar 0.3 all core scripts and modules use the PF loader.
#

#
# sample.dsm - Example module for DarkStar/EPIC4
#
# Standard header comment, you can put whatever you like here. To make
# things easy on other module authors, I like to include a line like the
# one below whenever I have /ON hooks.
#
# This script uses serial numbers 0 and 123 for all /ON hooks.
#

#### CLEANUP QUEUE ####

#
# The most important part, the cleanup queue. This removes anything
# that the module adds that is not automatically removed by the module
# loader. This means all /ON hooks and any alias, assign, or array
# not in a structure named after the module (i.e. Anything not obviously
# associated with that module). It is also important to note that there
# is one evaluation being performed on the body of this queue, so there
# are times you will have to escape certain characters like '$'. An example
# of this is shown here in the public hook. The name of this queue must
# be in the form of "cleanup.<modulename>" and must match the exact module
# name (if the module is named "foo2", the cleanup queue must be
# named "cleanup.foo2"). Also note that all /ALIAS, /ASSIGN, and /ON
# commands include the silent mode (^) to prevent them from outputting
# anything when the cleanup queue is executed.
#
queue cleanup.sample
{
	^alias -foo
	^on public -'% % \$CONFIG.SAMPLE_TRIGGER *'
	^on #hook 123 -"CONFIG SAMPLE_WINDOW *"
	@ delarray(foobar)
	if (winnum(sample) != -1) {
		^window sample kill
	}
}


#### CONFIG/FORMAT VARIABLES ####

#
# The /ADDCONFIG and /ADDFORMAT commands (provided by core/set.dsc) add
# config and format variables whose values can be changed via /DSET and
# /FSET. The '-b' option passed to /ADDCONFIG creates a boolean variable.
# Please see the comments in set.dsc for the complete usage of these
# commands. These variables are removed automatically when the module
# that added them is unloaded.
#
# IMPORTANT! The actual values of these variables will reside in the
# CONFIG structure and should be accessed (and sometimes directly changed)
# from there. See examples later in this file.
#
addconfig -b FOO 1
addconfig    SAMPLE_TRIGGER !foo
addconfig -b SAMPLE_WINDOW 1

#
# Format variables should be used with $fparse() and $fparse2() (the only
# difference is that fparse2 doesn't pass the string through $cparse() for
# color coding) and are generally used to format the output resulting from
# certain events. This allows for easy configuration as well as theme
# support.
#
# The numeric expandos ($0, $1, $2, etc.) will be expanded to the arguments
# passed to the fparse functions. Note that the first argument ($0) will
# be the name of the format variable so the useful parameters generally
# begin at $1.
#
# See the public hook for the call to $fparse() in this example.
#
addformat PUBLIC <%G$1%n> $3-


#
# Force the loading of saved settings early so we can use them at
# load time. Example directly below.
#
if (fexist($DS.SAVE_DIR/sample) == 1) {
	^load $DS.SAVE_DIR/sample
}

#
# Create a split window named "sample" at load time. This window
# can also be created or killed whenever $CONFIG.SAMPLE_WINDOW is
# changed via /DSET by creating an /ON hook that catches config
# changes. You can find an example of this below the public hook
# in this sample module.
#
# It is also smart to have the cleanup queue kill this window,
# if it exists when the module is unloaded. Another example of this
# can be found in modules/window.dsm.
#
if (CONFIG.SAMPLE_WINDOW)
{
	window new name sample hide
}


#### COMMANDS EXPOSED TO THE USER ####

#
# There is no way for the module loader to be sure what this alias belongs
# to, so it must be removed in the cleanup queue.
#
alias foo (void)
{
	echo foobar!
}


#### INTERNAL ALIASES ####

#
# This will automatically be removed by the module loader because it is
# in a structure named after the module. It does NOT need to be removed
# in the cleanup queue.
#
alias sample.speak (target defalt "$C", void)
{
	if (target) {
		msg $target foobar!
	}
}


#### ON HOOKS ####

#
# All /ON hooks must be removed in the cleanup queue or Bad Things (tm)
# will most certainly happen.
#
# Notice that the values of all config and format variables are
# stored and accessed in the CONFIG and FORMAT /ASSIGN structures.
#

on ^public '% % $CONFIG.SAMPLE_TRIGGER *'
{
	#
	# It is usually desirable to check for a value in format
	# variables before passing them along to $fparse(). This way
	# the user can suppress output by unsetting or emptying the variable
	# with /FSET -<var>
	#
	if (FORMAT.PUBLIC) {
		echo $fparse(PUBLIC $*)
	}

	if (CONFIG.FOO && finditem(foobar $0) == -1) {
		#
		# Cleanup!
		# As with aliases and assign variables, any arrays not
		# obviously associated with this module must be removed
		# by the cleanup queue. (e.g. an array named sample.foo
		# would be removed automatically by the module loader)
		#
		@ setitem(foobar $numitems(foobar) $0)
		sample.speak $0
	}
}

#
# Hooking /DSET config changes.
#
# This hook kills or creates the "sample" window whenever the user
# changes the value of $CONFIG.SAMPLE_WINDOW with /DSET. Since the
# new value of the variable is already stored in the CONFIG structure
# after it is set, the previous value is passed to this hook after the
# variable name in order to allow the module to reset it to the previous
# value. See the hook at the bottom of modules/names.dsm for an example
# of this.
#
# These hooks should always have a non-zero serial number since there is
# no need to suppress any default output/action. See Serial_Numbers(7) in
# the EPIC help files for more information on the use of serial numbers.
#
on #-hook 123 "CONFIG SAMPLE_WINDOW *"
{
	if (CONFIG.SAMPLE_WINDOW) {
		window new name sample last
	} else {
		window sample kill
	}
}

That should give you a pretty good taste of what makes up a module. At this
point you may want to have a closer look at the various modules that are
included in the script pack. Other areas of interest would be commands.dsc
and functions.dsc in the core/ directory. And if you feel brave, have a
peak at set.dsc and modules.dsc ;). Please feel free to email me (or better
yet drop by #epic on efnet) if you have a question about something not
covered here. That's all for now, happy scripting!
